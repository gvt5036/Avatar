      <description>The scene opens up in a forest. Katara and Aang are on a raised, grassy
                plateau. A gentle stream is running out beneath it. Katara is folding one of their
                sleeping blankets. Aang is lying on the root of a tree. Momo screeches and lands on
                the plateau as Sokka approaches.</description>

                both paws and slams it down on the big rock. The moment he does so, however, the

                his chin and stares toward Katara, cross-eyed. Sokka eyeballs an apple. Katara
                hunches forward with her eyes wide open, having stuffed her mouth with berries. Aang
                has his hand atop a barrel, beaming an immense toothy smile. His pose is short-lived
                as the barrel's lid spins, dunking Aang's hand into the barrel of water and causes

      <speech speaker="Sokka">I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are
            ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current
            from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and

      <description>Aang stops playing with the butterfly and Momo tries catching it as it
                flies away. As the group of spear-wielding guards approach, Katara and Sokka make a

      <description>At Katara's shout, Aang gasps quietly as he realizes his mistake by missing
                his cue. The young airbender ceases playing with the butterfly, leaps up, and blasts
                a strong jet of air into the ventilation duct, suddenly sending the boulder
                levitating into the air. This reveals Momo behind the boulder, who has his arms

      <description>Katara is in the back of a Fire Nation transport with other earthbender
                prisoners. She wears a brown, tattered prison garb over her blue Water Tribe outfit
                and stares glumly downward. Sokka and Aang each have conical yellow hats in a crowd,
                attempting to stealthily observe her travel. Katara looks longingly over shoulder as
                the cart bobs along a pier, heading toward a waiting barge on the
                ocean.</description>
      <description>Aang and Sokka chase the barge, riding Appa through the clouds. The
                immense, smoking, off-shore Fire Nation prison rig is seen just ahead. Close-up of

   <section>
      <description>After the barge arrives, six prisoners, including Katara, line up on the
                deck of the prison. Spear-wielding guards stand at either side. A prison warden
                approaches.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The warden pauses, suddenly interrupted by a prisoner in line coughing.
                With no forewarning, the warden leaps into the air and aims a blast of fire at the
                prisoner's legs in anger. The prisoner cowers away for safety as the warden stands
                defiantly toward the man.</description>

      <speech speaker="Warden">
         <charAction>Very angrily.</charAction> What kind of guest dishonors his host by

      <speech speaker="Warden">You will notice, earthbenders, that this rig is made entirely of metal. You are

                expansive ocean to the land far away.</charAction> So, if you have any illusions

      <description>A guard escorts the prisoners into the prison courtyard. Katara enters last
                and the metal gates close behind her. Among many earthbender prisoners, Haru takes
                notice of Katara. Above the courtyard, a watchman and the warden monitor the

      <speech speaker="Katara">Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe
            village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous
            earthbenders who guard its borders. <charAction>The watchman walks up to talk the
                warden, but the warden stops him and listens.</charAction> Some of you may think
            that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to
            bend. But they can't take away your courage. And it is your
            courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced
            to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that
            make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has
            eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So
            remember your courage earthbenders, <charAction>Shouts clearly.</charAction> let us
            fight for our freedom!</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Katara's speech is met with utter silence and a small cough in the
                background, leaving her to fall into sorrow as she realizes the muted answer she
                receives. The warden walks away from the courtyard. Later that night while she is
                sleeping, Aang sneaks into the prison and taps his hand to her shoulder, waking her.
                Urging her to be quiet, he leads her to the perimeter where Sokka and Appa are
                waiting to make their escape.</description>

      <description>Morning arrives, the scene gaining light. Sokka and Katara are alone by an
                air duct. Sokka is peering down into it, while Katara kneels beside it with her
                hands on its rim.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're
            gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. <charAction>The camera zooms
                through a visual walkthrough of Sokka's explanation.</charAction> There's a huge
            deposit of coal at the base of the silo. And the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed
            off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to
            go, right back here.</speech>

      <description>The two siblings are suddenly surrounded by a number of spear-wielding Fire
                Nation guards. The prisoners have gathered a safe distance away from this spectacle,
                observing what is happening.</description>

      <description>A sudden rush of air fills their ears as the facility shakes. The
                ventilation shaft bursts off its hinges as an immense blast of coal soars into the
                air, crashing down into a gathered pile. Everyone present is silent, staring in
                stark surprise at this turn of events. Lastly, Aang leaps out from the barren
                ventilation shaft, landing atop the coal pile and coughing, covered in soot and
                dirt. Momo follows him and Katara runs up to the coal, turning to face the
                earthbenders.</description>

      <description>Haru bolts ahead without hesitation, prepared to bend the waiting coal as a
                weapon. Tyro throws his hand up, bracing his son's chest to halt his
                advance.</description>

         <charAction>Bursts out into highly amused laughter.</charAction> Foolish girl. You
            thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people? Look at these
            blank, hopeless faces. Their spirits were broken a long time ago. <charAction>Katara's
                expression dims as she does as instructed, staring at the forlorn
                prisoners.</charAction> Oh, but you still believe in them. How sweet. They're a
            waste of your energy little girl. You <description>failed.</description>

      <description>The warden finishes his speech by turning to take leave of the facility. As
                he does so, a single piece of coal sails through the air and pelts the back of his
                head. Outraged, the warden spins back to see who dared to attack him. Haru stands
                defiantly levitating three pieces of coal above his hand. The warden sends a blast
                of fire toward Haru, but the fire is blocked, as Tyro raises a wall of coal in his
                defense.</description>

      <description>Slamming the coal to the ground; chunks of rock assault the guards. The
                battle immediately flares, prisoners ducking blasts of fire and countering with
                fists of coal. Katara and Aang chase after Sokka as he snaps soldiers spears in two
                with his boomerang, tossing the broken shafts to Momo overhead. Momo continues to
                collect other pieces of broken spears that are thrown up to him.</description>
      <description>Tyro and Haru work in unison to compress gathered coal into one lump,
                slinging this through the doors to make way for their escape. The guards on top fall
                down.</description>

      <description>Katara and Sokka drop heaps of coal into his funnel, firing the material
                rapidly at the warden and his fellow benders, knocking them to the ground. Following
                this, Tyro and two other earthbenders work together to lift coal beneath these
                adversaries, moving them away from the rig and over the ocean.</description>

      <description>Back on the prison rig, Zuko stands alone facing the sunset amid coal lying

                stare at it grimly.</description>

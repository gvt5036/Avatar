      <description>The short opens with the sea serpent emerging from the water, screeching,
                and diving back. Fade to the serpent the size of a seahorse swimming in a fish tank
                in which Aang is putting food into.</description>

      <description>The serpent seahorse swims off, as shot cuts to Aang putting down the fish
                food. Camera zooms back, as he runs to his seat in the classroom where all of the
                students are goofing around, with Longshot firing three arrows at the ceiling. Cut
                to a shot of Zuko and Jet sitting in the back of class, as the camera pans right.
                Cut to Smellerbee with a bored expression, as the camera pans left to show Pipsqueak
                holding a crumbled paper sheet near his head as Meng jumps and attempts to catch it.
                He throws the crumbled paper at The Duke's hands. The camera continues panning to
                show the young Koko from Kyoshi Island watching as Haru, standing near her, moves
                his wrists up and down to earthbend a rectangular column up and down. Cut to Katara
                writing a note at her desk, as Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee crowd around her, looking very
                angry. Azula uses lightning to shoot and fry Katara. Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee laugh
                together but stop when Katara turns back in anger. Cut to Aang folding an origami
                crane. Sokka tries to see what Aang is doing, but Aang slaps him on the face when he
                uses airbending to send the crane flying. A blast of fire burns the crane from the
                front of the class. Avatar Roku enters and the class instantly becomes more orderly,
                but not before Longshot manages to shoot three arrows at the middle of the
                ceiling.</description>

                folds it into an origami plane with a heart, and blushes. Cut to the plane landing
                on the book Katara is reading, as she quickly reads it. She blushes for a moment
                before being startled by Bumi's laughter. She looks at him as screen zooms back to
                show him laughing near her, crumbles the note in disgust, and walks away, throwing
                the crumbled paper at his face. As she walks away, Aang looks at her with a
                disappointed expression and facepalms, causing his forehead to have an imprint of
                his hand.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Katara looks at the flame with awe, but is startled by a rock pillar being
                earthbent behind her. She looks behind as shot cuts to her, Zuko, and Jet looking at

   <section>
      <description>Haru grins and breaks one of the hair loopies from the statue, subsequently
                kicking off its head entirely, before replacing it with Ty Lee's head using
                earthbending. Ty Lee looks at the statue and gets hearts as eyes. She jumps toward
                Haru and kisses him on the cheek, making loud kissing noises, pushing him from the
                shoulder and leaving a trail of hearts. The statue of Ty Lee watches the couple and
                blushes. Cut to Katara and Momo, as the latter tries to get the former's

                the shape of two Chinese characters. Cut to the glider, driven by Teo, and on top of
                which stands Aang bending the clouds which have formed into Chinese characters. Cut
                to a shot of the sky from the ground as Aang finishes writing the Chinese characters
                "卡塔拉 你可以跟我去跳舞嗎？ 昂". Below these characters, the glider moves in a straight path
                leaving a trail of clouds, which dissipates into the translation: "Katara, will you
                go to the dance with me? From Aang." Cut to an overhead shot of a surprised Katara
                with Momo crying in amazement next to her. Zuko, who accidentally squishes Momo,
                Jet, and Haru crowd near Katara, staring at the sky. Cut to the glider flying past
                them, as Aang jumps from it, landing near Katara on a heart-shaped air scooter. Aang
                turns away from Katara, smiling shyly.</description>

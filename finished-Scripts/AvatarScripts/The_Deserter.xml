      <description>The episode opens in a forest while Momo suddenly appears, jumping from a
                tree to another tree. A mysterious figure is seen following him, and Momo lands on a
                roadside kiosk, while Team Avatar is arriving at it.</description>

         <charAction>Walking toward a poster on the kiosk, present in the middle of a

                begins reading-out the poster.</charAction> Fire Nation cultural exhibits, jugglers,
            benders, magicians ... <charAction>Turns to Katara.</charAction> This would be a great
            place for me to study some real firebenders.</speech>

      <description>The gang chooses three masks. Katara chooses a lady with makeup, Sokka a
                blue smiling mask with petals around the rim, and Aang who chooses a red mask with a
                frown on it. Katara removes Sokka's mask, revealing him to be frowning, and Aang's
                mask, revealing him to be the one smiling. She places Sokka's original mask over
                Aang's face and Aang's over Sokka.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They make another turn, but the way they came is blocked by guards. Chey
                throws another smoke bomb and runs past them into another alley. They group comes
                across another dead end where there is an enormous supply of fireworks. Cut to an
                overhead shot that reveals Appa has arrived in the nick of time.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Appa! Down here!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa lands between the kids and the guards, with his backside facing the
                guards. Appa airbends a gale force wind which results in the guards getting blown
                out of sight. As the guards run back into the alley, Appa has already taken off. Cut
                to Chey, he bites the top off a bomb to light it. He throws it at the fireworks
                supply and it blows up creating a beautiful display of fireworks. Cut to Chey
                removing his hood as they cruise away.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chey">I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend,
            Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an
            admiral?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Not amused.</charAction> He was very highly ranked, we get it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chey">Yeah! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more. He's the first person
            ever to leave the army - and live. I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for
            that. That's okay though. Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius. Some say he's mad - but
            he's not! He's enlightened.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?

      <speech speaker="Chey">
         <charAction>Annoyed; Stands up to gesture.</charAction> He's not crazy! He's a
            genius! And he's the perfect person to train the Avatar! That's why I followed you into
            the festival.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the North Pole in the
            morning.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually
            be willing to teach me.</speech>

      <description>As Sokka turns to pout, he almost runs right into a spear. In a flash, they
                are surrounded by men wearing straw hats, light armor, wearing tribal make up, and
                wielding spears.</description>

      <description>Chey walks toward Jeong Jeong's cottage. Back in the Fire Days Festival in
                the now deserted central square of the town where some guards are being interrogated
                by Admiral Zhao who is accompanied by a few guards himself.</description>

      <speech speaker="Guard captain">
         <charAction>Anxiously.</charAction> Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went
            off without a hitch! <charAction>A huge piece of burning planks of wood falls in the
                background with a massive crash making the guards twitch.</charAction> No fights.

      <description>Back in the settlement, Chey exits Jeong Jeong's cottage. He arrives back
                where Aang and the others are fast asleep. Everyone wakes up instantly as Chey

         <charAction>Looking downcast.</charAction> He won't see you. He's very angry that I

      <description>Aang walks to Jeong Jeong's cottage. He takes a deep breath, parts the
                curtain, and walks into the darkness. Cut to a dark figure seated cross legged
                amidst a semicircle of candles, his back to Aang.</description>

      <speech speaker="Jeong Jeong">Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny? If a fish lives its whole life in this

      <speech speaker="Jeong Jeong">Are you deaf? How can I teach you if you refuse to listen? Before learning
            firebending you must learn water and earth. Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady
            and stable, but fire, fire is alive! It breathes, it grows. Without the bender, a rock
            will not throw itself! But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one
            does not have the will to control it! That is its destiny! You are not ready! You are
            too weak!</speech>

      <description>At this final gesture the candles around Jeong Jeong violently flame up to
                illuminate the entire hut before quickly going out. A vision in front of Jeong Jeong
                begins, as one candle is seen lit in front of the firebender. A tree is in the
                background behind the Deserter. In front of him, stands Avatar Roku.</description>

      <description>In the morning outside of Jeong Jeong's cottage. Sokka is sitting on a
                boulder by the river, fishing. The screen pans up the river where Katara is
                practicing waterbending before switching to Aang and Jeong Jeong in front of the
                cottage. Aang stands, bandy legged, on a flat stone in the river. Jeong Jeong stands
                a foot or two away on the bank in front of his cottage.</description>

            to destroy his opponents and wipe out the obstacles in his path, but fire is a horrible
            burden to bear. Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything
            around it. <charAction>While he was speaking, the camera cuts to Zhao on his boat;

      <description>The scene cuts to Katara who is sulking by a creek due to the pain of her

                are healed.</description>

      <speech speaker="Jeong Jeong">You have healing abilities. The great benders of the Water Tribe sometimes have this

      <description>Suddenly the water is front of them is blasted with flames. Jeong Jeong
                gets up and gets into a defensive bending stance and breaks the flames that wash

      <description>Jeong Jeong faces the boats that land harmlessly around him. The screen

                lowers it and smiles. The screen goes back to Jeong Jeong produces a large wall of
                fire in front of the ships. An overhead shot of the ships is shown; the boats turn
                to land on the beach. The screen goes back to the front of the beach. Zhao comes

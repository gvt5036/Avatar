      <description>The episode opens on board a Fire Nation ship where Aang finally regains
                consciousness. The camera zooms out on his face as he opens his eyes and rises from
                his bed, visibly shaken and in pain, and now with a head full of hair.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">What happened? <charAction>Sees the Fire Nation designs and flag and immediately
                assumes he has been captured.</charAction> Oh no!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He leaves his room, carefully creaking open the door and peering outside
                for any sign of Fire Nation soldiers. Using his glider as a crutch, Aang stumbles
                across the hall, occasionally leaning on the wall for support due to being weak. He
                stops at a turn in the hallway upon hearing two guards, who are actually Pipsqueak
                and The Duke, talking to each other.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Pipsqueak">You hear something? <charAction>Aang retreats behind the wall, where he dons a
                determined look and quickly steps out to send a weak air blast at them, which only
                ruffles their clothes, and moves past the hallway.</charAction> He's awake!
                <charAction>The two begin chasing Aang, who struggles to escape.</charAction> Stop!
            Wait!</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Aang manages to reach the deck of the ship, however, he stumbles on the
                stairway and drops his staff. It slides over to where Hakoda and Bato, disguised as
                Fire Nation soldiers, are petting Momo.</description>

      <description>Momo runs toward Aang, jumps on his shoulder and licks his face. Toph and
                Katara, standing near the edge of the ship, hear the events.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The screen becomes black as Aang collapses to the floor, Katara running
                short of catching him. The shot cuts to the entire group, including Appa,
                surrounding Aang who is now in Katara's arms. Meanwhile, on another ship, Zuko is
                heading toward the Fire Nation. Mai joins him.</description>

                holds his face in her hands.</charAction> Stop worrying.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The two kiss. Mai exits, and Zuko stays there with an expression of relief
                on his face. We return to the ship where Team Avatar is on. Aang is awake once
                again. He sits in front of Katara, also sitting, surrounded by Toph and Sokka. Appa
                rests behind them. Aang receives a robe to cover him.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the

   <section>
      <description>As Katara bends the water from Aang's scar, he suddenly jerks backward and
                again flashes back to the battle at Old Ba Sing Se, to the moment where he was shot
                by Azula's lightning. The flashback scene then changes to Katara is tearfully
                looking over Aang, looking comatose, flying on top of Appa as they flee Ba Sing Se.
                After that, he snaps back to reality.</description>

   <section>
      <description>A flashback shows the Dai Li taking down Ba Sing Se's walls and the Fire
                Nation troops entering the city as Earth Kingdom citizens look on with fear. Tanks
                are seen approaching the Ba Sing Se's royal palace before flashing back to Li and Lo
                with Azula approaching between them.</description>

      <description>Zuko approaches with a worried expression. Crowd cheers. We now go back to
                Team Avatar's ship. Sokka sits on a crate with a map with the others surrounding him
                as he narrates past events.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">After what happened at Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety. We flew back to
            Chameleon Bay where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men.
                <charAction>Flashback preparing to leave by taking off his Earth King robes
                revealing traveling robes beneath.</charAction> The Earth King decided he wanted to
            travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone. <charAction>Bosco is shown taking off
                his own attire and hat before Kuei jumps on Bosco and they set off.</charAction>
            Well, not completely alone. <charAction>Cut back to Sokka continuing the
                story.</charAction> Soon, the bay was overrun by Fire Nation ships. Rather than
            fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise. Since then we've
            been traveling west. We crossed through the Serpent's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a
            few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">So what now?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Hakoda">We've been working on a modified version of the invasion plan.</speech>

         <charAction>Sharply.</charAction> It's Sokka's> invasion
            plan.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Hakoda">Yes, Sokka's plan. We won't be able to mount a massive invasion without the Earth
            King's armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave the Fire Nation
            vulnerable.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies
            from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Pipsqueak">

      <speech speaker="Sokka">And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage!

      <speech speaker="Aang">The world thinks I'm dead? How is that good news? That's terrible!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Approaching Aang.</charAction> No, it's great! It means the Fire Nation
            won't be hunting us anymore! And even better, they won't be expecting you on the Day of
            Black Sun!</speech>

      <description>She metalbends the bridge between the ships off. The captain and his guards
                fall into the water. Katara creates a large wave which separates the other ship from
                theirs. Team Avatar's ship departs quickly. The captain and his guards from the
                other ship climbs back on board theirs by rope ladder. Meanwhile, back at the Fire
                Nation Capital, Zuko feeds turtle ducks in a lake with some bread. Azula joins

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>During flashback.</charAction> This is water from the spirit oasis at

      <description>Back at the ocean. The second ship begins firing at Team Avatar's. Toph
                takes an earthbending stance while The Duke stands behind her to guide

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Pipsqueak drops a boulder in front of Toph who begins earthbending it at
                the attacking ship. It hits a catapult as another fires. others try to fight back
                with a series of rocks that Toph earthbends at the other ship. With The Duke's
                guidance, Toph earthbends another piece of rock and sends it to intercept the
                oncoming fireball. Aang, inside the ship with Sokka, makes a move to help but is
                stopped by Sokka. In frustration he bangs his head against his staff. The other ship
                fires a harpoon, piercing a hole in Team Avatar's ship's bottom. As water flows in,
                Katara, noticing this, freezes the water below to plug the hole.</description>

      <description>He takes a deep breath and swims under it. Upon emerging, he finds a tree
                bark and rides it like a surfboard through the water. A storm turns the seas very
                choppy. He falls off and into the water and his staff flies away. Back to the

         <charAction>Sighs and opens her eyes.</charAction> Fine. You seemed so worried about
            how Father would treat you because you hadn't captured the Avatar. I figured if I gave
            you the credit, you'd have nothing to worry about.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Azula">Please Zuko, what ulterior motive could I have? What could I possibly gain by
            letting you get all the glory for defeating the Avatar? <charAction>Approaching close to
                Zuko she places a hand on his shoulder.</charAction> Unless, somehow, the Avatar was
            actually alive. All that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness. But you
            said it yourself, that was impossible. <charAction>Zuko begins to leave.</charAction>

      <description>Back in the sea, Aang struggles to stay above water or reach his glider.
                After letting out a scream, a wave overcomes him and he falls into the water. He

                the same crescent island where Roku's temple once was. Later, Momo finds him and
                licks his face, waking him up. Katara, Sokka, and Toph find him, reaching him via

      <description>The episode begins with an aerial shot of Appa, still in his armor, and the
                rest of the gang, now including Haru, The Duke, and Teo, searching for the Western
                Air Temple on foot. Cut to Toph leading with Haru and Sokka behind. Cut to Aang,

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Looking up at her.</charAction> You mean getting thoroughly spanked by
            the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Haru">
         <charAction>Frontal view.</charAction> They're probably on their way to a prison.

                of the gang.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka looks around before shrugging. Cut to the front of the gang as the
                camera pans down, revealing the temple, hidden under the cliff.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Wow ... it's amazing!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>At another part of the temple, Zuko descends down a rope and swings back
                and forth twice before jumping down. When he lands on the ground, he has a flashback
                to three years ago, just after his banishment. Cut to a frontal shot of the cliff
                similar to the one Toph and the group were on earlier. Camera pans down to show the
                various natural structures through the mist of the temple.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">The only view I'm interested in seeing is the Avatar in chains.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">You know, the Avatar hasn't been seen for one hundred years. The chances of finding
            him here are very slim. <charAction>Cut to a shot of Zuko's bandaged
            side.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Determined.</charAction> First we'll check each of the air temples, then
            we'll scour the world, searching even the most remote locations until we find
            him.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Prince Zuko, it's only been a week since your banishment. You should take some time
            to heal and rest.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">What else would I expect to hear from the laziest man in the Fire Nation?
                <charAction>Iroh sighs.</charAction> The only way to regain my honor is to find the
            Avatar, so I will.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Iroh walks away as the flashback ends, fading to Zuko who looks
                disappointed in himself. Zuko notices Appa flying nearby and hides quickly. He
                subsequently runs off. Cut back to Team Avatar.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Teo">It's so different from the Northern Air Temple. I wonder if there are any secret
            rooms.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Why can't I go?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">We need to decide what we're gonna do now, and since you're the Avatar, maybe you
            should be a part of this.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Sitting down.</charAction> Fair enough. So, what's the new
            plan?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan! You just need to master all four
            elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Oh, yeah. That's great, no problem. I'll
            just do that.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Aang, no one said it's going to be easy.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Well, it's not even gonna be possible! Where am I supposed to get a firebending
            teacher?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">We could look for Jeong Jeong!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Shooting her idea down.</charAction> Yeah ... right. <charAction>He lays
                down on the bench without a care.</charAction> Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong
            again.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Curiously.</charAction> Who's ... oh, <charAction>She folds her arms
                irritably.</charAction> never mind. If it's important I'll find out.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we just take a nice tour
            around the temple? <charAction>He and Momo fly off.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">What's up with him?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">There's gotta be someone who can teach him firebending.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara and Toph look down dejectedly as the camera slowly pans up and fades
                to a smiling Zuko in a forested area with his tent.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Hello ... <charAction>Raises an arm in greeting.</charAction> Zuko here, but I guess
                <charAction>Rubs his hand against the back of his head nervously.</charAction> you
            probably already know me, sort of. Uhhh ... so, the thing is I have a lot of firebending
            experience, and I'm <charAction>Places an arm on his chest with pride.</charAction>
            considered to be pretty good at it. <charAction>He continues smiling.</charAction> Well,
            you've seen me, you know, when I was attacking you. <charAction>His eyes
                widen.</charAction> Uhhh ... yeah, I guess <charAction>Places his fingers against
                his forehead in embarrassment.</charAction> I should apologize for that. But anyway,
                <charAction>Waves an arm to the side dismissively.</charAction> I'm good now.
                <charAction>Clenches both fists and places one on his chest while the other arm is
                raised.</charAction> I mean, I thought I was good before, but I realize I was bad,
                <charAction>He gets visibly uncomfortable and drops his arms into a
                slouch.</charAction> but anyway, I think it's time I joined your group and taught
                <charAction>Straightens up with a sincere expression on his face.</charAction> the
            Avatar firebending. <charAction>A badgerfrog croaks at him. Angrily.</charAction> Well,
            what's your answer? <charAction>The badgerfrog hops on his head before hopping
                away.</charAction> Yeah ... that's what I'd say, too. How am I supposed to convince
            these people that I'm on their side? What would Uncle do? <charAction>Imitating
                Iroh.</charAction> Zuko, you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your
            other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself. <charAction>Normal
                voice.</charAction> Even when I'm talking for him I can't figure out what he means.
            What would Azula do? <charAction>Imitating Azula.</charAction> Listen, Avatar, I can
            join your group, or I can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends.
            Your choice. <charAction>Normal voice. Stops and sits down.</charAction> I guess I'm
            just not that good at impersonations.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A badgerfrog jumps in front of him as he sits and croaks. Meanwhile, Aang
                is flying on his glider. Sokka, Katara, and Toph follow him on Appa.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">What? The wind is too loud in my ears! Check out this loop!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang proceeds to do a loop.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Okay, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table! Oh, you're gonna love
            the all-day echo chamber!</speech>

      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Cut to a close up of Toph as she turns serious.</charAction> I think
            that'll have to wait.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Toph points behind herself, and the camera zooms out to show Team Avatar
                looking at her quizzically. Appa moves out of the way to reveal a shadow, and as the
                camera pans up, it is revealed to belong to Zuko. Cut to a close-up of the team as
                they look at him with shocked expressions, which subsequently turn into
                anger.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Cut to a close up of Zuko's face.</charAction> Hello ...

            here.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>The gang prepares to attack.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Hey, I heard you guys flying around down there, so, I just thought I'd wait for you
            here. <charAction>Appa growls at him and licks him twice. Cut to a surprised Momo and
                Aang as he lowers his staff slightly.</charAction> I know you must be surprised to
            see me here.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Not really, since you've followed us all over the world.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Right. Well, uhhh ... anyway ... what I wanted to tell you about is that I've
            changed, and I, uhhh, I'm good now, and well I think I should join your group, oh, and I
            can teach firebending to you. <charAction>The gang expresses shock.</charAction> See, I,
            uhhh ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">You want to what now?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid
            do you think we are?!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Yeah, all you've ever done is hunt us down and try to capture Aang!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I've done some good things! I mean, I could have stolen your bison in Ba Sing Se,
            but I set him free. That's something! <charAction>Appa licks him again, much to his
                surprise.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Appa <charAction>The siblings turn toward her.</charAction> does seem to like
            him.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him.
            I'm not buying it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I can understand why you wouldn't trust me, and I know I've made some mistakes in
            the past.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Like when you attacked our village?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture
            us?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Look, I admit I've some awful things. I was wrong to try to capture you, and I'm
            sorry that I attacked the Water Tribe. And I never should have sent that Fire Nation
            assassin after you. <charAction>Toph and Sokka's eyes widen with shock.</charAction> I'm
            going to try and stop-</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Ohhh, sorry. I didn't mean to insult your
            friend!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Angrily.</charAction> He's not my friend!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">That guy locked me and Katara in jail and tried to blow us all up!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>To Aang.</charAction> Why aren't you saying anything? You once said you
            thought we could be friends. You know I have good in me.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description> Aang turns to look at his friends, and Sokka shakes his head at
                Aang.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done. We'll never let you
            join us.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">You need to get out of here. Now.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I'm trying to explain that I'm not that person anymore!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Either you leave, or we attack.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">If you won't accept me as a friend, then maybe you'll take me as a prisoner.
                <charAction>Zuko kneels down, bends his head, and raises his arms in
                surrender.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">No, we won't! <charAction>Blasts water at him.</charAction> Get out of here, and
            don't come back! And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you
            again!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko walks away. Cut back to Zuko's campsite.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Uggh! I can't believe how stupid I am! I mean, what was I thinking? Telling them I
            sent an assassin after them? Why didn't I just say Azula did that? They would have
            believed that! Stupid! <charAction>A badgerfrog croaks at him.</charAction>
            Uggh!</speech>

      <description>Back at the air temple.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Why would he try to fool us like that?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se. He starts talking
            about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with
            feelings.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he
            strikes.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really
            confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid
            the price. We can't trust him.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got
            captured by Zhao?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap
            that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I could feel it! It's my throatal flap!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out. He
            risked his life to save me.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">No way! I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">You're probably right.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Actually, he wasn't lying.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least
            he didn't add animal cruelty to the list.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">I'm just saying that, considering his messed-up family and how he was raised, he
            could have turned out a lot worse.</speech>

      <description>Meanwhile, Combustion Man eyes the gang from a higher elevation. He sets

                off-balance, causing his shot to be wild. Team Avatar make to run away before
                hearing Zuko.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">Stop! <charAction>Team Avatar turns their head up to the sound.</charAction> I don't

                up with shock as he is helping Sokka carry Toph. Cut back to Zuko as he stands in
                front of Combustion Man, arms spread out to block him.</charAction> The mission is
            off. I'm ordering you to stop.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">If you keep attacking, I won't pay you! <charAction>Attempts to firebend at him, but

            stop!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko kicks Combustion Man as he fires, causing him to miss again. He
                subsequently takes aim at Zuko. Zuko creates a firewall to stop the attack but is
                pushed off the ledge. Cut to a shot of Team Avatar looking over the edge of the
                fountain shocked. Cut to a shot from behind Combustion Man as he faces a small
                crater in the floor and the smoke that is dissipating. Cut to a shot of the edge of
                the ledge and strafe right, revealing climbing a vine hanging underneath it and Zuko
                survived by grabbing the plant's root. Cut to Combustion Man as he turns back. Cut
                to a close up of Aang as he stands up from behind the fountain pool and runs to the
                side. Cut to a shot of Aang doing a spinning back kick, airbending and kicking up
                the dust around him, and leaping straight up just as a blast from Combustion Man
                explodes beneath him. The camera turns up to Aang spinning in mid air, airbending a
                tornado and kicking it at Combustion Man. Combustion Man leaps over the tornado and
                fires another blast as he descends. Aang lands and quickly back flips away from the
                blast, landing next to Katara and Sokka. Cut to a shot of Combustion Man falling
                before switching to a shot of his metal, clawed hand as it catches on a small ledge
                and breaks it, slowing his fall. He lands on a new ledge and rolls, firing a blast
                just as he stops. Cut to a shot of Katara and Aang shielding themselves as the blast
                hits the fountain water. The camera follows Katara as she runs forward and bends the
                water from the pool. Cut to a far shot from the side as Katara bends a huge wave up
                between them and Combustion Man. Cut to a shot in front of the camera as she
                descends from jumping, bringing her arms down and crossing them and giving a battle
                cry. The wave matches her arm movements and icicles in both directions. Cut to a
                shot of Combustion Man as the icicles speed toward him. He brings his metal arm over
                his face and lifts his metal leg to shield him from the attack. The icicles break
                against him. Combustion Man flings his arms down to shake off the ice shards and
                steps forward, an angry frown on his face. Cut to his perspective as he scans the
                area. The group is nowhere to be seen. Aang fires a tornado, which the assassin
                jumps over and fires again. Aang narrowly avoids the blast by jumping back.
                Combustion man falls and lands on a ledge as he fires and misses again. Katara bends
                water from the fountain and turns it into ice spikes, but Combustion Man appears
                unaffected. The assassin looks up and realizes they have disappeared but continues
                firing. Cut to shot of the team hiding behind a wall, out of sight.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">He's going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side!</speech>

                blast.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">I can't step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and I can't get a good
            enough angle on him from down here.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Pausing for a moment to think before having an idea.</charAction> I know
            how to get an angle on him! <charAction>Takes out his boomerang. After another blast, he
                sneaks his head out, but has to hide from another shot. He projects Combustion Man's
                angle with his boomerang.</charAction> All right buddy, don't fail me now!
                <charAction>Throws his boomerang.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The boomerang hits the assassin in the head where his third eye tattoo is,
                causing him to hit the ground, before it returns back.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Yeah, boomerang! <charAction>Jumps up and grabs it, but Combustion Man gets up,
                albeit clearly shaken.</charAction> Awww, boomerang ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>As the team runs back to their hiding spot, Combustion Man gears up again,
                but is dizzy and cannot aim properly. His next shot fails to escape, causing an
                explosion around him resulting in the building he stands on getting destroyed. Cut
                to his metal arm as it flies away from the explosion, followed by the falling
                building. The gang looks on, shocked. Haru, Teo, and The Duke all appear from behind
                a pillar also shocked.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Zuko climbs a plant root, having survived the ordeal. Later, Zuko again
                approaches the gang.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... thanks, Zuko.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hey, what about me? I did the boomerang thing.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Listen, I know I didn't explain myself very well yesterday, I've been through a lot
            in the last few years, and it's been hard. But I'm realizing that I had to go through
            all those things to learn the truth. I thought I had lost my honor, and that somehow my
            father could return it to me. But I know now that no one can give you your honor. It's
            something you earn for yourself, by choosing to do what's right. All I want to do now is
            play my part in ending this war, and I know my destiny is to help you restore balance to
            the world. <charAction>To Toph.</charAction> I'm sorry for what I did to you.
                <charAction>Bows to her.</charAction> It was an accident. Fire can be dangerous and
            wild, so as a firebender, I need to be more careful and control my bending, so I don't
            hurt people unintentionally.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Looks at Zuko shocked, hearing these words, and thinks for a
                moment.</charAction> I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I
            first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to
            firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you
            love. I'd like you to teach me. <charAction>Bows before Zuko.</charAction>

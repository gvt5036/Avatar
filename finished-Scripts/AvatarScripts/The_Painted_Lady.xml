      <description>The episode opens with Appa, the gang in his saddle, slogging his way down
                the course of the sludge-infested river Jang Hui in the Fire Nation. Aang and Momo
                are frolicking in the putrescent water.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Momo! <charAction>Dives into the water.</charAction> Oh Momo! <charAction>Dives
                again and Momo flies to Aang.</charAction> Hahahahaha! You found me, buddy!
                <charAction>Looks down at the water in distaste and airbends up to Appa's saddle,
                where he stands dripping in sludge.</charAction> Hey guys, I think this river's
            polluted. <charAction>Airbends mud off himself, splattering the rest of Team Avatar with
                mud, which causes them to cry out in disgust.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Tastes mud on her mouth, and spits.</charAction> Pah! Plegh!
                <charAction>Aang airbends again, blowing the rest of the mud back into the river and
                messing up their hair.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing
            skills are off the hook! <charAction>Holds up a fishing hook. The gang is unamused as
                Aang sits back down.</charAction> Get it? Like a fishing hook?
                <charAction>Grinning.</charAction>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Countering.</charAction> Too bad your skills aren't on the
            hook.</speech>

      <description>Toph, Aang, and Katara laugh as Sokka makes a disgruntled
                face.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food, <charAction>Unrolls a
                long scroll in front of her.</charAction> assuming that'll fit into Sokka's master
            schedule.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hmmm ... It's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Hey, maybe we can get food there! <charAction>Points at a village in the middle of
                the river.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <description>The camera zooms to the village and fades to Appa as Aang hides him under a
                mat of grass.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Now you look just like a little hill with horns! Bye, buddy!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa groans as Momo briefly reveals himself under some more grass nearby.
                Scene changes to the Jang Hui River, while Toph, Katara, Aang, and Sokka approach
                the river.</description>

      <speech speaker="Dock">Wow ... Colonials. Hop on, I give you ride in the town.</speech>

      <description>The scene changes to the river, while Dock paddles the boat
                across.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Why do you guys live on the river? <charAction>Looking at the

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Dock">
         <charAction>Turns his paddle to the right side, pointing at the Fire Nation
                factory.</charAction> Because we're a fishing town. At least that's how it was
            before the factory moved in. <charAction>Closer shot of the Fire Nation factory and pans
                down.</charAction> Army makes their metal there. Moved in a few years ago and
            started gunking up our river. <charAction>Shot changes back to the ferry. Aang and
                Katara glance sadly at each other.</charAction> Now our little village is struggling
            to survive.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The camera pans downs to the villagers, showing their conditions of poverty
                and starvation. Team Avatar gets off the ferry boat.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Thanks for the ride! <charAction>Waves his hand to Dock, who waves
                back.</charAction>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Cut to three villagers sitting on a porch.</charAction> Look at this
            place. <charAction>Cut to two other villagers, an old man and a young boy.</charAction>
            It's so sad. <charAction>Cut back to Katara looking down.</charAction> We have to do
            something to help.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">No, we can't waste our time here. We have a bigger mission that we need to stay
            focused on. These people are on their own.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Chases Sokka and grabs his shoulder.</charAction> These people are
            starving! But you'd turn your back on them? <charAction>Puts her hands on her
                hips.</charAction> How can you be so cold and heartless?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Shot changes to show their argument from the river as a barrel bobs up
                and down.</charAction> I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic. We can't
            go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by
            taking out the Fire Lord. <charAction>Aang guides Toph toward the arguing
                siblings.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Covering Sokka's mouth with her hand.</charAction> Hey, loud mouths!
            Maybe we should be a little quieter when we talk about 
                <charAction>Quietly.</charAction> "taking out the Fire Lord."</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come
            first.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Reluctantly.</charAction> I guess so. <charAction>Looks
                annoyed.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Let's just get what we need and go. <charAction>Smiling to Katara, who smiles
                back.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to an aerial view of the village. The shot changes to show the counter
                of an outdoor market stall. As Team Avatar walks up to it, they notice a man who
                looks like Dock, but wearing a different hat, bowed behind the
                counter.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hey, Dock. You work here too?</speech>

      <description>Team Avatar looks confused.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes. <charAction>Close-up of
                his hat.</charAction> The only difference is your hat.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Xu">
         <charAction>Camera zooms out to Xu talking.</charAction> Dock works on the docks.
            That's why we call him, "Dock", and I work in the shop, that's why they call me,
            "Xu"!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I don't get it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Xu">Me neither. <charAction>Jumps down behind the counter and pulls out a crate filled
                with rancid gray seafood.</charAction> What I can getcha? <charAction>Katara, Aang,
                and Sokka look disgusted.</charAction> Hey, I'll give you a special deal. If you buy
            three fish, I'll give you a clam for free. <charAction>Sokka pushes a clam, and mucus
                splashes out from it.</charAction>
      </speech>

      <description>Aang and Katara both recoil, muttering in disgust.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Picks up three fish. Carefully.</charAction> We'll just take the fish.
                <charAction>Xu takes the fish.</charAction> Mind telling your brother we need a ride
            back to shore? <charAction>Xu jumps down behind the counter and jumps up wearing Dock's
                hat.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Dock">Hey, colonials! My brother says you need a lift. <charAction>Jumps over the counter,

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Touched.</charAction> I wish I could help more. <charAction>Gives the

                mother.</charAction>

   <section>
      <description>Fade to nighttime, as the camera shows an aerial view of Team Avatar's
                camp. Shot changes to show a barrel of polluted water. Aang lifts the water with
                waterbending and Toph separates the pollutants from the water with earthbending.
                Aang passes the water to Katara, who boils it in a crock.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take
            some serious finagling to get us back on track.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Finagle away, oh schedule master.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier
            every day.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Forty<description>-three</description> minutes?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Pointing to various spots on his schedule.</charAction> Look, we only
            have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse,
            which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we
            want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Well <description>I'm</description> not waking up early.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">What?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">No way!</speech>

      <speech speaker="Toph">Forget it!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Gets a sly look on his face.</charAction> I got it, how's this from now
            on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara, Toph, and Aang express their disgust at this idea with Aang doing a
                spit take.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first
            thing tomorrow morning.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Close-up of Katara's face, who looks distraught at Sokka's words. Cut to an
                aerial view of the village the following morning and cut to the campsite. Appa lies
                on his side, groaning, while Katara ministers to him.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">What's the matter Katara?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">I think Appa's sick.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Panicking.</charAction> What? Appa's sick? That's awful!</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Wow, Sokka, I didn't realize you cared so much.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now.
                <charAction>Pulls out his schedule. He stops and looks at the group. Cut to a shot
                of the rest of the gang giving him the evil eye, and he quickly changes his tone,
                rushing solicitously to Appa's side.</charAction> And I'm concerned because my big,
            furry friend doesn't feel well.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">He must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy? <charAction>Appa groans and Aang pulls out
                Appa's purple tongue.</charAction> His tongue is purple! That can't be good. Katara,
            can you heal him?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in
            town.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Momo arrives and attempts to lick Appa's tongue before being pulled off by
                Aang. Cut to the village, which is bustling and lively. One villager pole vaults
                from one house to another.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Is it just me, or does this place seem different?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Yeah, are the people ... happier?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The little boy from the previous day runs by, bouncing a ball, and Katara
                smiles to herself. The kids walk up to Xu/Dock's market.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Xu">
         <charAction>Drinks from a ladle.</charAction> Ah, something amazing happened last
            night. Food was delivered to our village by a mysterious and wonderful person ... the
            Painted Lady.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">The Painted who now?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Xu">The Painted Lady. <charAction>He places a miniature statuette of the spirit down on
                the counter.</charAction> She's part of our town's lore. They say she's a river
            spirit who watches over our town in times of need. I always thought she was just a
            legend. Until now.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them. All
            we need is medicine for our sick friend.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Xu">Medicine? Sorry, all the medicine we have goes to the factory. That's why there's so
            many sick people in our village.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Sighs.</charAction> I guess you're right. You got any more food to
            sell?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Xu">
         <charAction>Goes under the counter and emerges holding a fish in each
                hand.</charAction> Would you like the one-headed fish, or the two-headed fish?
                <charAction>He turns the fish on the left sideways to show the second
                head.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Ponders.</charAction> Two-headed! <charAction>The rest of the group
                lowers their heads and small sweat drops appear.</charAction> What? You get more for
            your money that way! <charAction>Holds up the polluted fish.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The rest of the group get even bigger exaggerated sweat drops as they
                express their disgust and run away from Sokka who follows behind with the polluted
                fish. </description>
      <description>Fade to the village, late that night. A figure resembling the Painted Lady
                glides over the water on a carpet of fog and enters the village. She steps into a
                hut where several people are sleeping on the floor, and bends over each of them in
                turn, healing them with a blue glow. Her last patient is the mother of the little
                boy seen earlier, her son sleeping at her side. He wakes as the Painted Lady turns
                to go and silently follows her out the door.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Little boy">Thank you, Painted Lady.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The lady stops and nods her head before disappearing into the water. Cut to
                the village, the next day. Dock polishes his figurine with a rag as Sokka steps up
                to the counter.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hi, Dock. Is Xu around?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Dock/Xu">Let me check ... <charAction>He runs around the shop and ducks beneath the counter
                to switch hats.</charAction> Hey there! Back again, are ya?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Pushes Sokka away.</charAction> We need more food. <charAction>Slams the
                money on the counter.</charAction> Our friend is still sick and we can't leave until
            he's better.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Xu obligingly presents them with a platter of polluted clams. The camera
                pans in on the clams. Sokka comically slides in behind them and gives silent chuckle
                along with a comical annoyed symbol on his forehead. It appears he has an idea
                brewing.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Xu">Oh, well, that's too bad. Maybe if you guys are lucky, the Painted Lady will visit
            you in the night, and heal your friend.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Picks up the clams. Sarcastically.</charAction> And maybe she'll cook us
            a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Xu">
         <charAction>Not getting the sarcasm. Sokka looks annoyed now.</charAction> Yeah,
            maybe! You know, last night she visited us again. Healed most of our sick
            folks.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Is that why this place seems so festive?</speech>
   </section>

      <description>A villagers raises a large statue of the Painted Lady in the town square,

      <speech speaker="Katara">Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ...
            spirit?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Gets annoyed.</charAction> Why would you say that? Look how much better
            off these people are.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she
            really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory.
                <charAction>He makes mocking gestures to indicate explosive spirit magic. He crosses
                his arms with a smile. Katara gets even more annoyed. The screen pans to the right
                to show Aang who has his arms crossed not impressed.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like ... <charAction>He waves
                his body with arms in the air making similar gestures to indicate spirit magic.
                Katara storms away from the two.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Aang and Sokka">
         <charAction>Sokka wraps and arm over Aang's shoulder and the two combined their

      <description>Cut to Katara on the edge of a dock looking out toward the factory. Cut to
                the campsite, that night. Katara slips out of her sleeping bag and stuffs dried
                grass into it to disguise her absence. She dons a makeshift Painted Lady costume,
                wrapping a ragged gown around her. Katara bends the water to make a mirror so she
                can apply the markings. She puts on a wide conical hat similar to the Painted
                Lady's, but with a diaphanous white veil covering her face. She glides away toward
                the village, but not quietly enough; she wakes Momo, and he wakes Aang by jumping on
                him.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">What's the matter, buddy? <charAction>Katara leaves Team Avatar.</charAction> It's
            her! <charAction>Excited, waves his hand to Katara and puts on his
                headband.</charAction> Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara shocked, quickly flees from Aang. Meanwhile, Aang uses his
                airbending to accelerate his run. The camera moves to a hill as Katara climbs up and
                continues on as Aang easily keeps up.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Jumps up the hill.</charAction> Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you,
            but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule. <charAction>Continues to
                follow her down the hill as she crosses the river.</charAction> Wait! But I'm a
            great bridge between your world and mine! <charAction>Aang freezes some water to form
                stepping stones to cross the river.</charAction> I know Hei Bai! We're close
            personal friends! <charAction>Katara moves faster, and Aang jumps on a wooden bridge.
                Katara runs out of the river onto the docks and notices Aang's reflection in the
                water. She looks up and sees Aang running across a roof.</charAction> Heeey!
                <charAction>He suddenly hits a pole, Katara flinches and feels sorry for him but
                continues on across the river to the other side. She stops to look out at the
                village thinking she is safe but Aang drops in front of her.</charAction> My name's
            Aang. I'm the Avatar. <charAction>Lifts his headband and points at his
                arrow.</charAction>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Yeah, me too. I hate that. <charAction>Looks at Katara's face from behind the
                veil.</charAction> You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too
            many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive. <charAction>Looks at Katara
                suspiciously. Tries to look under the hat.</charAction>

   <section>
      <description>Aang gives her a curious look. Cut to the Fire Nation factory. Aang and
                Katara run along the river's edge toward it. Aang looks at the polluted
                water.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">You wanna destroy this factory?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the
            only way to help these people permanently.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang and Katara enter and move to different sides of the factory. Katara
                uses waterbending to cut the metal hooks that hang barrels of a magma. Aang, with
                protective gloves on, overturns bigger hanging barrels, smiling at his work. Aang
                uses earthbending to break apart the pipe system in the factory. Katara bends a huge
                wave of water through the windows and floods the factory. The scene cuts to outside
                as the factory explodes from within and muck stops flowing from the pipes. Cut to
                Aang and Katara walking back to their campsite. Aang laughs and makes explosion
                noises.</description>

         <charAction>Angrily and disappointed.</charAction> Oh, really? A morning walk?
                <charAction>Dumps the hay out of Katara's sleeping bag.</charAction> I know you're
            the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying
            about Appa and been feeding him <charAction>Sticks out his own tongue.</charAction>
            purpleising tongue berries! <charAction>Toph sticks out her tongue and shows that it is
                purple and holds up a bag of berries which Momo starts eating.</charAction> Katara,
            what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now!</speech>

                factory where a man can be seen coming out of the smoke and looking angrily toward
                the town. Cut to Team Avatar packing, but they pause when they hear buzzing. The
                factory workers are shown headed for the town on jet skis. Cut to the gang on a

   <section>
      <description>Aang turns to Toph for confirmation. Toph, however, elbows him and he falls
                off camera with a thump. Cut to the Fire Nation soldiers on jet skis. Cut to Team
                Avatar looking at the village. Cut to Mung and his soldiers standing on the
                dock.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Mung">I thought we could live as neighbors, in peace. But I guess I was wrong. You steal

         <charAction>Holding a statuette.</charAction> Oh, right, the mysterious Painted Lady

                <charAction>Throws the statuette at the container, smashing it. The crowd
                gasps.</charAction> This is a town of thieves and liars! <charAction>Firebends a

            to cure the world of this wretched village.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The soldiers begin demolishing the town. A jet ski, with two soldiers, goes
                past a dock as a soldier sends a hook and chain toward it. The chain wraps around a
                log holding up a house and it breaks as the jet ski drives away. The house crumbles
                into the water. Cut to two soldiers who light a large flammable ball perched on a
                buoy in the river, but a mysterious gust of wind blows out the fire,
                twice.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Mung">Light it again!</speech>
   </section>

      <description>They follow Mung's command, and it is blown out again. Eerie flute music
                begins floating over the water.</description>

      <speech speaker="Male Fire Nation soldier">I don't know. Something strange is going on.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>A repetitive thudding noise, as of giant footsteps, has begun. Pan over the
                river to the further bank where we see that the thudding is caused by Toph elevating
                and dropping a large boulder, while Appa provides the growling. Sokka mans the
                flute, producing eerie noises.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The fog parts dramatically to reveal Katara in full Painted Lady regalia.
                She pauses a moment and rushes toward the soldiers with a burst of waterbending. She
                alights on the dock and slowly approaches them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Mung">Do something! <charAction>Pushes his soldiers forward. As they timidly draw near,
                they are rattled by a blast of airbending. Aang is shown hiding beneath the dock.
                The two soldiers run off. To the remaining soldiers.</charAction> Stand your ground!
                <charAction>Katara waterbends two jet skis into a nearby cliff. As she raises her
                hand to wreak further damage, the soldiers jump into the remaining jet skis and
                speed off, leaving Mung.</charAction> I'll take care of you myself.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He bends an arc of fire at Katara, we see it advance toward her in slow
                motion. Aang, still concealed beneath the dock, sends Katara flying into the sky on
                a column of air; the flame passes harmlessly beneath her. Aang rends the dock in two
                with a blast of wind, sending Mung flying into the river. As he flounders, Katara
                rises out of the polluted water before him and raises her arms
                threateningly.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Leave this village and never come back.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He swims desperately away from her. A stray jet ski passes by and he
                clambers into it; the ski buzzes off. Sokka and Toph row toward the village as the
                people applaud Katara as she returns to the dock.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her,

      <speech speaker="Katara">Sokka, it's okay. <charAction>She steps forward and moves Sokka back. To the

            shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if
            the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real.
            You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Dock">No, ma'am. I'm going to get my other brother, Bushi. He loves cleaning rivers.
                <charAction>Dock brazenly switches hats right in front of them.</charAction> All

      <description>Aang fumes in annoyance. Cut to an aerial view of the village with boats in
                the surrounding river. The shot changes to the boats on the river as the villagers
                spread clean out the pollutants. Katara bends the water into a large vat while Aang
                and Toph separate the pollutants using earthbending and putting it in a large boat.
                Cut to an aerial view of the village as the day passes by and the river becomes
                cleaner. Cut to Team Avatar's campsite at night. Katara sits on an overlook of the
                river when suddenly clouds of fog appear and the real Painted Lady
                emerges.</description>

      <description>The episode opens to two fox antelopes, grazing on a hill side. They look
                up at the monorail tracks behind them as a monorail goes past, pushed by two
                earthbenders. Cut to inside the car where Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Momo are
                awaiting their arrival at Ba Sing Se. Katara looks out from the window and notices
                the Inner Wall of the Earth Kingdom capital drawing closer.</description>

         <charAction>Slightly skeptically.</charAction> Hey, don't jinx it! We can still be

            submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp!</speech>

                see, and it has many roads and buildings. Their train enters the monorail station,

                other side of the track, where there is a woman with long dark hair that billows in

   <section>
      <description>Team Avatar has a confused look on their faces regarding Joo Dee's strange
                statement. Cut to an overhead shot of the area of the city near the wall. An ostrich
                horse pulls a carriage through the streets. Many shops and refugees line the
                streets. Cut to a shot of the inside of the carriage containing Joo Dee and Team

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Joo Dee">Oh, Ba Sing Se has many walls! There are the ones outside protecting us, and the
            ones inside, that help maintain order. <charAction>Shot changes to outside the carriage
                as the camera pans across some refugees.</charAction> This is where our newest
            arrivals live, as well as our craftsman and artisans, people that work with their hands.
                <charAction>Shot changes back to inside the carriage.</charAction> It's so quaint
            and lively!</speech>

      <description>Cut to a shot of two men conversing in an alley. One of them is holding a
                large sword that glistens in the light. Both glare at the carriage as it passes. Cut
                back to the carriage, where Katara becomes unnerved, her face blanking out, while
                Momo, who was looking out of the window by hanging from the ceiling, quickly
                retreats completely into the carriage.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Upset and somewhat bored.</charAction> This is why I never came here

                flora and Iroh.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Smellerbee">Jet, you saw a man with a hot cup of tea. It doesn't prove he's a firebender. And
            what if he is, are we supposed to attack them‌? I thought we were starting over here,
            changing our ways.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">We are. When I get the evidence I need, I'll report them to the police and let them

      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Quickly holds the cup at a distance.</charAction> Blech!

      <description>Cut to a shot of Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph standing at the steps of

                Fade to a shot of some apartments. Jet spies on Zuko and Iroh, from a balcony in the

      <description>Fade the next morning, and the scene changes to a blue jay chirping, before
                the camera pans down to Team Avatar's house. Cut to Katara coming out from the door,

      <description>Zuko takes the customer's broadswords and enters a fighting stance. He
                pulls a table in front of him with his foot and kicks it at Jet, who slices the
                table with his swords and jumps over it. As he lands, he swings both hook swords at
                the Fire Nation prince, who deflects the attack and jumps backward on to another
                table, which is sliced in half by Jet, swinging one sword through the middle of the
                table. Zuko steps onto one half of the table and balances on one foot. Jet continues
                his attack by cutting the legs on the half of the table Zuko is standing on. Zuko
                quickly jumps up, and as he lands, he swings both broadswords at Jet's feet, and Jet
                somersaults away and lands in a crouching position before charging forward at Zuko
                again. Zuko swings both of his swords at Jet. Just as both weapons clash together,
                the scene freezes and cuts to the Ba Sing Se Palace. Several high class citizens are
                lined up and being admitted inside by a guard, who is checking the invitation of one
                group before letting them pass. Toph and Katara are next in line and approach

      <description>Long Feng walks toward the guard at the entrance with Toph and Katara
                following him. The guard bows to him and the three of them go into the palace. As
                they are walking in, Toph and Katara stick their tongues out at the guard while his
                back is turned. The scene changes to an overhead shot inside the palace. At one end
                of the table is Bosco the bear eating a steak, his drool dripping of his chin.

                Zuko's broadsword with the ends of his hook swords, spins around and deflects it to
                the side. Zuko spins with his swords and tries to counterattack, but Jet hooks the
                ends of his swords together and begins to swing them at Zuko in large circular

                Zuko's blade, cutting the straw sticking out of Jet's mouth in half. The scene

                to Aang who has reached the other end of the dining table on his air scooter,
                knocking over several dishes. He dismounts the scooter and holds his arms up in
                triumph. Long Feng walks up to Aang from behind the line of guards.</description>

      <speech speaker="Long Feng">Avatar, it is a great honor to meet you. <charAction>He bows.</charAction> I am Long
            Feng, Grand Secretariat of Ba Sing Se and head of the Dai Li. I'd like to talk to you.
            Your friends will be waiting for us in the library.</speech>

      <description>Long Feng gestures Aang to follow him, as he goes into the library. Aang
                hesitates for a moment before hopping off the table and following. Cut to a shot of
                the library's large double doors shutting. The camera zooms out to show Aang and his
                friends facing Long Feng, who is sitting in front of a hearth that illuminates the
                area with a green flame.</description>

      <description>The camera shifts behind Aang's party and pans slowly to the right. Long
                Feng is visibly seated in front of them as the camera passes by each
                member.</description>

                <charAction>Cut back to Long Feng.</charAction> It is the strict policy of Ba Sing
            Se that the War not be mentioned within the walls. <charAction>Scene changes as he talks
                to the two Dai Li agents dragging Jet into a dark room, making him sit on a stone
                chair.</charAction> Constant news of an escalating war will throw the citizens of Ba

      <description>The agent stands in front of Jet, surrounded by a metal track. From behind
                him appears a small orange lantern attached to the track. It travels around the
                track and passes the camera, causing a white flash that cuts back to Long
                Feng.</description>

      <description>Aang and his friends stare at Long Feng with a mix of shock and horror at
                this revelation. The screen flashes white again. Cut to a close-up of Jet. A circle
                of stones covers his mouth, muffling his protests. The lamp passes by his eyes
                again. Cut to a shot of the Dai Li agent standing within the circular track as the
                lamp continues revolving.</description>

         <charAction>Side-view of room.</charAction> Until now, you've been treated as our

                forward and bends down to look Aang in the eye. Aang stares back at Long Feng,
                angrily.</charAction> But from now on, you will be watched every moment by Dai Li
            agents. If you mention the War to anyone, you will be expelled from the city.
                <charAction>He turns around and walks over to the hearth with the green
                fire.</charAction> I understand you've been looking for your bison. <charAction>View

      <description>The episode opens just outside the vast waters of Lake Laogai. Team Avatar
                has stopped on a tiny islet in the center of the lake. Aang is embracing Appa, happy
                upon reuniting with him.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy. <charAction>Momo flies into Appa to
                hug him too. Appa licks Aang, which causes Aang to laugh.</charAction>

      <description>Sokka approaches Katara and Toph.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Look, we escaped from the Dai Li. We got Appa back. I'm telling you, we should go to
            the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens,
            we'll need the Earth King's support.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">What makes you think we'll get it? I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't
            usually go that smoothly for our little gang.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be
            different.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too
            powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind
            us.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">I'm with Sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se. <charAction>Raises arms and
                opens eyes wide.</charAction> And I can't even see!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang flies into the shot.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">But now that we have Appa back, there's nothing stopping us from telling the Earth
            King the truth. About the conspiracy and the War.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">See? Aang's with me. <charAction>Puts his arm around Aang and smiles.</charAction>
            It's the whole reason we came here in the first place. We have to try.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Thinks for a moment.</charAction> Well, I guess if the Earth King knew
            the truth, things could change. <charAction>Sokka and Aang smile.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Stands up.</charAction> I don't trust the new positive Sokka.
                <charAction>Points at Sokka in an accusing manner.</charAction> Long Feng
            brainwashed you, didn't he!?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang notices a few ships in the lake.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">That's probably the Dai Li searching for us. <charAction>To Katara.</charAction>
            So?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara thinks for a moment before looking at Sokka.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Determined.</charAction> Let's fly!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They fly toward the Palace, now with no saddle, holding onto Appa's fur for
                dear life, especially Toph.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Can we please buy a new saddle? Riding bareback is terrifying! <charAction>Buries
                face in Appa's back.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They get closer to the palace.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">There it is! That whole thing is the palace! The Earth King's chamber should be in
            the center!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're
            coming.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in
            and- <charAction>A giant rock almost hits them.</charAction> Aahh!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">What was that?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Surface-to-air rocks! <charAction>Sees more being launched.</charAction> More
            incoming!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They dodge a few more rocks. One gets launched right at Aang, but he
                destroys it with his hand. Another is launched at them head on, but Aang slices it
                cleanly in two by swinging his staff at the rock to augment his earthbending. He
                launches himself from Appa to the front of the palace and slams his staff into the
                ground, generating a massive earthen wave to knock back the palace guards. Appa
                lands and roars at the captain's ostrich horse, which causes it to drop the captain
                and run off. As they continue toward the Earth King, more guards appear and launch
                earth cubes at the gang. Toph and Aang use earthbending to block the attacks, while
                Katara uses waterbending to subdue the guards.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Water whips two guards.</charAction> Sorry!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara turns around and strikes down more guards with her waterbending,
                though closes her right eye in a sympathetic flinch for a moment as she does so. As
                more guards rush toward them in an attempt to halt Team Avatar's progress, Toph uses
                her earthbending to flip the tiles of the walkway, trapping them between them and
                ensuring a clear passage for the team.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>More guards appear on the opposite end of a bridge and launch two giant
                statues at them. Toph and Aang create an earth igloo to block the statues. Katara
                creates an ice ramp to jump to the other side of the bridge and water-whips the
                guards into the water. Aang freezes them in the water as the rest all jump across.
                More surface-to-air rocks appear as guards are coming down a giant staircase. Toph
                uses earthbending to change the stairs into a ramp, causing them all to fall. She
                and Aang use earthbending to escalate themselves up the stairs.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side! <charAction>Pauses for a
                moment.</charAction> Sorry.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>More guards come and Aang and Toph push them away with
                earthbending.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">In there! <charAction>They enter the palace.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They come to an area with three doors. More guards appear and Toph easily
                defeats them all.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Toph, which way to the Earth King?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">How should I know? I'm still voting we leave Ba Sing
            Se.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Toph defeats more guards while Sokka opens the doors to find the Earth
                King. The first room is empty, as is the second; outside the second door, a royal
                guard goes flying to the right off-screen. Sokka bursts into a third room, startling
                a woman.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Palace woman">Burglar! <charAction>Tries to run, trips, and falls flat on her
            face.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Shuts the door.</charAction> Sorry. Wrong door.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Meanwhile, Zuko and Iroh return from Lake Laogai. The former seems
                ill.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">You did the right thing. Letting the Avatar's bison go free.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I don't feel right. <charAction>Gets dizzy and passes out.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Zuko! <charAction>Rushes to him.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Back at the palace, the team arrives at a pile of rubble. Sokka climbs atop
                it and sees a gigantic door.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere. <charAction>Drops down from
                the rubble and attempts to kick the door open.</charAction> Yaaah! <charAction>The
                door does not move even slightly. Sokka starts trying to push it open, but to no
                avail. Toph and Aang jump in from behind and bust the door down, knocking Sokka
                forward in the process. He starts rubbing the back of his head.</charAction> A
            little warning next time?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They arrive in the Earth King's chamber with Kuei sitting in his throne.
                Long Feng and his Dai Li agents stand in their way. The team takes fighting stances
                against them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">We need to talk to you.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">
         <charAction>Turns to face the Earth King.</charAction> They're here to overthrow
            you.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">No, we're on your side. We're here to help.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">You have to trust us.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">
         <charAction>Stands up with a rising aggravated tone.</charAction> You invade my
            palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door, and you expect me to trust
            you?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">He has a good point.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">If you are on my side, then drop your weapons and stand down!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They look at each other for a moment. Aang drops his staff, Katara puts her
                water whip back in her water skin, Sokka drops his machete, and Toph drops the
                boulder she is levitating.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Smiles.</charAction> See? We're friends, Your Earthiness.
                <charAction>Gives a slight nervous chuckle.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The king says nothing and just continues to frown grimly. Long Feng signals
                the Dai Li to cuff their arms with rock gloves.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">
         <charAction>Smiles sinisterly.</charAction> Detain the assailants!</speech>

      <description>The Dai Li rush behind Team Avatar.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again. <charAction>The king
                looks at him shocked.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">The Avatar? <charAction>Points at Sokka.</charAction> You're the Avatar?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">Uh, no. Him. <charAction>Nudges his head at Aang.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Effortlessly breaks free of his earth cuffs and raises his
                arms.</charAction> Over here. <charAction>Re-attaches the
            cuffs.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">What does it matter, Your Highness? They're enemies of the state.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">Perhaps you're right. <charAction>Sees Bosco sniff and lick Aang, who laughs, and
                smiles at Long Feng.</charAction> Though Bosco seems to like him. <charAction>Looks
                back at the team.</charAction> I'll hear what he has to say. <charAction>Long Feng
                glares at Aang.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Walks forward.</charAction> Well, sir, there's a war going on right now.
            For the past one hundred years in fact. The Dai Li's kept it secret from you. It's a
            conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">A secret war? That's crazy!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">Completely!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us. And
            blackmail is the least of his crimes; he brainwashed our friend!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">
         <charAction>Quickly turns to face the king.</charAction> All lies. I've never even
            seen a sky bison, Your Majesty. Frankly, I thought they were extinct.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">
         <charAction>Sits down.</charAction> Your claim is difficult to believe. Even from an
            Avatar.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">
         <charAction>Whispers in his ear.</charAction> These hooligans are part of an
            anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks. <charAction>Kuei looks
                shocked at what Long Feng is telling him.</charAction> If you listen to them, you're
            playing right into your own destruction.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">
         <charAction>Thinks for a moment.</charAction> I have to trust my advisor.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The agents start taking the team away, but Sokka stops for a
                moment.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Wait! <charAction>Turns to face the king with a big smile.</charAction> I can prove
            he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison. Ask him to lift his
            robe.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">What? I am not disrobing! <charAction>The king looks
                thoughtful before looking at Sokka suspiciously.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang and Sokka smile slyly and nod at each other. Aang blows a large gust
                of air at Long Feng's legs, lifting his robe and revealing a bite mark left by
                Appa.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Right there! Appa bit him!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Never met a sky bison, huh?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">
         <charAction>Lowers his robe.</charAction> That happens to be a large birth mark.
                <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Thanks for showing everyone.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">Well I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Of course there is!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The group gets Appa and brings him in. He opens his mouth. Aang points at
                the bison's teeth and at Long Feng's mark.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">Yup. That pretty much proves it. <charAction>Team Avatar cheers.</charAction> But it
            doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory. <charAction>Team Avatar becomes
                downcast.</charAction> Though, I suppose this matter's worth looking into.
                <charAction>Team Avatar look at each other approvingly, while Long Feng glares at
                the king before walking away with his agents.</charAction>

      <description>Back in Iroh and Zuko's apartment, Zuko is asleep. He wakes

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">You're burning up. <charAction>Dips a cloth in water.</charAction> You have an

      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Grabs a bucket with a spoon in it; takes out the spoon.</charAction>
            Here's some clean water to drink. <charAction>Sits him up slightly.</charAction> Stay
            under the blankets and sweat this out.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko grabs the spoon from Iroh and drinks the water. He tosses the spoon
                aside and grabs the bucket. He drinks from it, while spilling some out. He tosses
                the bucket aside and lies back down. Iroh pulls the covers more over him. Meanwhile,
                on a train, passengers are shocked to see the Earth King, who is standing in the
                middle of the cart surrounded by guards.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">
         <charAction>Feeling strange from exposition.</charAction> So this is what a train is
            like? I didn't realize it would be this ... public.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">I've never been outside the palace. <charAction>Katara and Sokka look at each other;
                the Earth King looks outside and sees Aang flying on Appa.</charAction> Now that's
            the way to travel. <charAction>Looks at Katara and Sokka.</charAction> So, may I ask
            where we're going?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're
            about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to the shores of Lake Laogai. The team stand on the shore beside the
                Earth King and his guards. Toph steps to the edge of the water, and with a hop,
                reveals the the secret path to the hatch door entrance, though discovers it has been
                destroyed.</description>

      <speech speaker="Toph">It's gone!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Oh don't tell me- ! <charAction>Gives a thumbs up and a fake smile.</charAction>
            That's okay. Still got my positive attitude.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Kuei">
         <charAction>Looks suspicious.</charAction> Hm ...
                <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> That seems awfully convenient.</speech>
   </section>

      <description>Appa flies off. Back at the apartment, Iroh and Zuko are asleep. Zuko wakes
                up and walks into the bathroom. He washes his face with water. When he looks in the
                mirror, he sees himself with no scar, no hair and an arrow tattoo on his head,
                resembling Aang. He looks horrified. He screams himself awake and breathes heavily.
                He touches the scar on his face and closes his eyes. Meanwhile, Appa is flying Sokka
                and Aang. Sokka is resting across Appa's back.</description>

      <description>The episode begins with the camera panning up from the sandy desert to the
                library and Appa. The words "FOUR WEEKS AGO ..." fade on and off the camera. Cut to

      <description>Cut to Appa growling as sandbenders tie him with ropes. One sandbenders
                tugs on a rope tied to Appa's head. Appa lifts his head, sending the sandbender
                flying and tumbling through the sand. Two more sandbenders let go of their ropes and
                scatter to avoid Appa's tail. Appa becomes more annoyed.</description>

      <speech speaker="Toph">Don't make me put this down! <charAction>Lets go of the library and sends a slice of
                sand at the sandbenders, which misses completely. She grabs the library

      <description>One sandbender throws a rope around Appa's mouth, but Appa breaks it and
                makes the sandbender fall down. Another sandbender throws a rope around Appa's horn
                and Appa's sends the sandbender that tried to put a muzzle on him flying through the
                air. Appa takes off, but a sandbender throws a rope around Appa's leg and uses
                sandbending to secure his feet. The other sandbenders follow his lead and they all
                force Appa to the ground. A sand-sailer sails next to Appa. The sandbenders use
                their sandbending to drag Appa with three sailers. Cut to Toph, still holding onto
                the library.</description>

      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Regretfully.</charAction> I'm sorry, Appa. <charAction>She sniffles and

   <section>
      <description>The camera pans to the right to show Appa. Cut next to Appa, who lowers his
                eyes. Fade to the sun and pan down to the sailers crossing the desert. On one of the
                sailers, Ghashiun lowers his mask and signals them to stop.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The two sandbenders jump onto Appa's saddle, stirring some sand. Appa
                sneezes, sending the center sailer into a sand dune. Cut to Ghashiun and a
                sandbender, who talk while, in the background, two sandbenders throw the contents of
                Appa's saddle in the background onto the ground.</description>

            merchants.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The other sandbender picks up the parasol and opens it. Cut to a small camp
                of merchants which the sandbenders bring Appa to using the two remaining
                sand-sailers. Three merchants walk around Appa's head to bargain with

                box which he opens and closes before walking to the side. A large beetle drags Appa
                onto the merchants' caged sled. Cut to an overhead view of Aang gliding over the

      <speech speaker="Trainer">
         <charAction>Sighs.</charAction> I understand <charAction>The camera fades from black
                to show a circus trainer standing outside a cage.</charAction> you've had a rather
            hard time lately. That's too bad. You probably felt you had no choice but to behave
            outrageously, like a wild animal. <charAction>Cut to outside the cage, where the trainer
                pats Appa on the head.</charAction> But don't worry. You won't anymore.
                <charAction>Frontal shot. Darkly.</charAction> Because I am going to break
            you.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The shot changes to show Appa's cage next to other animal cages. Fade to a
                large circus tent. Inside, the trainer rolls a cart of cabbages and gives one to a
                platypus bear. He passes Appa, who tries lifting his chained legs and biting off the
                chains. The trainer gives a cabbage to a lion vulture.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Trainer">Hungry? <charAction>Walks up to Appa.</charAction> Don't worry, I'm going to feed
            you too. <charAction>Shows a cabbage to the drooling Appa.</charAction> But not yet.
                <charAction>Takes away the cabbage as Appa tries to slurp it up. Walks up to the
                lion vulture.</charAction> First, I'm going to show you how you'll earn it.
                <charAction>Gives the cabbage to the lion vulture and opens the
            cage.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The lion vulture flies around the room and the trainer uses a fire whip to
                control it. Appa pays little attention to the man and looks at the cart of cabbages.
                He uses air suction to bring the cart closer to his cage and sucks up a cabbage. Cut
                to the lion vulture flying through two hoops and making loops. It grabs the third
                ring with its beak and throws it at the trainer, who catches it. Appa continues
                sucking cabbages into his mouth while the trainer's back is turned.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Trainer">Of course, when you perform, the hoops will be flaming. And if you are careful, you
            won't get burned. <charAction>Appa belches loudly and the circus trainer quickly turns
                around.</charAction> You're about to be sorry. <charAction>Firebends a whip and
                creates a fire in front of Appa's cage, causing Appa to panic.</charAction> It's
            obvious that whoever your previous owner was, he had no idea how to handle you
            properly.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to the circus tent at night as carnival music plays and people gather
                round the entrance. Cut to tent flap opening where people walk past outside. A small
                boy walks past, but walks back when he sees Appa try to suck up a bale of hay in the
                tent. The boy looks questioningly at Appa, who licks the bar of the cage. The boy
                looks understandingly at the sky bison and the boy's father walks behind
                him.</description>

      <speech speaker="Fire Nation man">
         <charAction>To the boy.</charAction> I'm gonna to go get a bag of sizzle crisps.

                at Appa.</charAction> stay away from that monster. Behave yourself or
                <charAction>The boy flinches slightly.</charAction> you'll regret it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The boy runs into the tent and rolls the bale of hay right up to Appa's
                cage. Appa licks the boy's face in appreciation and starts munching down the hay.
                The shot changes to above Appa's head, and the boy runs away once he hears
                voices.</description>

            He's a difficult creature, stubborn and willful. I need more time with him. It's too

      <speech speaker="Shuzumu">
         <charAction>Closer shot of him and the trainer.</charAction> Too risky? What are you

      <description>Appa sighs and puts his head on the cage floor. Fade to the circus tent,
                still at night. Cut to inside, where two women perform by holding three spinning
                plates in each hand and five men in the background with painted faces form a human
                pyramid. The two women walk to the sides to reveal two platypus bears balancing on
                balls. Cut to the applauding crowd. In the front row, the boy from earlier tries to
                get some sizzle crisps from his father, but the man holds it away from the
                boy.</description>

      <description>Shuzumu gestures toward a curtain which drops to show Appa dressed in a
                costume complete with make-up. The audience laughs at the creature, while the boy
                looks at it with concern. Appa walks onto the center ring.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Trainer">Up. <charAction>Appa shakes his head and turns around in a circle. The audience

      <description>Appa flies through a fiery ring and stands on a platform with one leg. Cut
                to the boy, who looks concerned. Appa flies through a second ring and his costume
                catches on fire. Appa knocks down the next ring with his tail. The ring hits the
                trainer on the head and knocks him down. Appa lands and looks at the laughing crowd.
                He focuses on the young boy and sees Aang laughing in a flashback. Appa shakes his
                head, and his costume hair falls off.</description>

      <description>Appa knocks the man up into the air with his tail. Cut to outside the
                circus tent, where the trainer flies out. Appa flies out of the tent through the
                ceiling, leaving his costume behind. The boy looks up at Appa flying away and
                smiles. Appa flies over the desert and sees a large crater. Cut to Appa's flashback
                of the library which had been there before. Cut back as Appa lands in the center of
                the pit and looks around. He tries digging with his chained feet, but gives up and
                falls asleep.</description>
      <description>Cut to Appa flying over the desert and his stomach grumbles. Cut to a
                purple egg which Appa tries to eat, but a gilacorn snatches it and runs away. Appa
                flies to a cactus, scaring away a jackalope. He eats the cactus, but roars in pain
                and spits it out due to the sharp prickles. Cut to Appa flying again, this time more
                wearied. He sniffs for food and flies toward the Si Wong Rock. Cut to the buzzard
                wasp nests, which Appa flies into and starts eating, but quickly flies out when the
                buzzard wasps start attacking. Appa uses airbending to knock down all of the buzzard
                wasps, which scatter afterward. Appa lands, panting, and licks the yellow substance
                on his feet and arms until he stops and begins to rest.</description>
      <description>Cut to Appa flying across the setting sun. He finds a barn, takes a drink
                out of the trough, eats some hay, and falls asleep. In his dream, he sees the
                Eastern Air Temple. Five baby sky bison fly through the air, and circle around their
                mother. They gather close to her. Cut to Sister Iio, who holds a bowl of apples for
                the young airbending monks.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iio">Choose well. A sky bison is a companion for life.</speech>

      <description>Further shot of the sky bison family landing and Iio throws the mother an
                apple. Shot of Appa and the camera pans to the younger Aang, who offers the apple.
                Appa sniffs the apple and Aang gives it to him. Aang hugs Appa, who returns the
                affectionate gesture by knocking Aang down to the ground and licking his
                face.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to Aang, who is dreaming while camping at the Serpent's Pass. He laughs

   <section>
      <description>Appa stands up and the farmer backs away. The farmer's wife enters the barn
                and holds up a torch. Appa backs away from the flame, standing on his forelegs. The
                farmer and his wife run away screaming. Appa breaks a hole in the ceiling to escape.
                Cut to the farmer and wife as they watch the sky bison fly away. Cut to Appa flying
                over the Serpent's Pass. Cut to a ship and cut to a shot of Iroh looking overboard.
                Iroh gasps when he sees Appa fly overhead.</description>

      <description>Cut to a forest. Appa flies down and crash lands in front of a tree growing
                over a passage. He bites some grass and stands up when he hears squealing from the
                passage. Cut to in front of the passage where a boar-q-pine runs out of the shadows
                and toward the camera. Appa roars at the boar-q-pine, which tackles him and they
                fall down a cliff. They stop rolling when they reach a clearing, Appa's fur being
                prickled with some of the boar-q-pine's quills.</description>
      <description>The boar-q-pine roars at Appa, and Appa roars back. They start to circle
                each other, the camera first showing a view with Appa in front before switching to
                the boar-q-pine in front. The boar-q-pine charges at Appa, knocking him into a tree
                which falls down. Appa grabs the tree with his mouth and throws it at the
                boar-q-pine, who jumps over the trunk and charges at Appa. Appa stands on his rear
                legs, grabs the charging boar-q-pine, and throws it to the side. The shot changes to
                a farther distance where the dust from the sliding boar-q-pine rises above the tree
                tops and scatters some birds. In a closer shot, the boar-q-pine stops sliding and
                runs away, squealing. Appa pants and grabs a quill from his leg, roaring in pain as
                the camera zooms back.</description>
      <description>Cut to the passage. Appa flies over the hill and walks into the passage,
                collapses and falls asleep. Cut to the outside of the passage, in which time changes
                from evening to night, and it starts raining. Fade to a berry bush where a hand
                picks a berry. The shot changes to the next day, showing the Kyoshi Warriors picking
                the berries, and pans to the right. On one of the bushes, a Kyoshi Warrior picks up
                a clump of Appa's fur.</description>

      <speech speaker="Suki">Wait, let me see that. <charAction>The Kyoshi Warrior hands the clump of fur to
                her.</charAction> No, it couldn't be. <charAction>The camera pans up to show Appa's
                trail of fur on the cliff. Suki follows the trail and gasps when she reaches the
                top.</charAction> Appa? Oh, no. <charAction>Close-up of Appa, who backs away into
                the passage in fear as Suki walks up. She stops and kneels down, putting several
                berries and an apple on the ground.</charAction> It's gonna be okay, Appa.
                <charAction>Stands up and back away.</charAction> I have to leave, but I'm gonna be
            back soon with help.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Suki walks down the cliff. Appa walks up the fruit and looks at it. Cut to
                a later time where Appa rests in the passage. The camera pans down to Suki leading
                five Kyoshi Warriors up the side of the cliff.</description>

            It's our responsibility to get Appa back to him safely. This could be our most important
            mission yet. <charAction>The Kyoshi Warriors peer over the top of the hill at Appa, who
                growls and shakes his head at the intruders.</charAction> Give him some space!
                <charAction>The other Kyoshi Warriors take a step back. Suki takes a step
                forward.</charAction> Appa, it's me, Suki. I'm a friend. <charAction>Appa growls and
                Suki slowly approaches Appa.</charAction> I want to help you. You're hurt. We can
            help you feel better. <charAction>Appa growls in response.</charAction> And we can help
            you find Aang. <charAction>Appa softly growls and Suki places her hands Appa's nose and
                Appa lies down with Suki kneeling in front.</charAction>

                out of the shadows. Appa growls at him and takes a step back, leaving a single
                footprint in the mud. Long Feng earthbends the slab of rock beneath him, causing it
                to swirl around and capture Appa underground. Shot of Appa's footprint in the mud
                fades to a further shot of the dust around the slab of rock dissipating. Fade to

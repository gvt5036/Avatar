      <description>The episode opens in a forest. Momo is chasing a bug through the trees. In
                his pursuit he lands on the ground to see a neatly stacked pile of lychee nuts. When
                he runs toward it, Momo is pulled into the air by a cage trap, joining two other
                caged animals. Camera changes focus to find the rest of Team Avatar
                camping.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Where's Momo? <charAction>Camera zooms in to close-up shot of Aang, Katara, and
                Sokka, the siblings sitting next to each other with bored faces, and Aang standing
                with his back to the camera. Momo screeches and the gang looks
            around.</charAction>

      <description>Camera fades to find Aang as he spots the three animals in their cage traps
                hanging by rope on tree limbs.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Hang on, Momo! <charAction>Aang uses his airbending to fly to the top of the tree,
                jumping from trunk-to-trunk to get higher. He finds the traps' mechanisms, undoes
                them, and carefully lowers Momo to the ground where Katara and Sokka are waiting.
                They open the trap together and the lemur runs out with one of the lychee nuts in
                his mouth. Katara and Sokka look on as Momo gets on his hind legs and eats it as
                though nothing has happened. Sokka grunts in frustration and facepalms. When Aang
                lands, he looks up to see the other two animals seemingly crying out to him for
                help.</charAction> All right, you too. <charAction>Jumps up to
            them.</charAction>

   <section>
      <description>The hog monkeys run up the tree and out of the camera's view and Aang jumps
                back down, dirt flying from the ground as he lands. Everyone gathers around two of
                the traps and Sokka kneels down to examine them.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">These are Fire Nation traps, <charAction>Camera zooms to upward shot of the gang

      <description>Sokka sees a Fire Nation campsite with a lot of soldiers; most of them are
                seated or crouched near the fire with bowls in hand and a couple of them sit close
                to the tents, which have the Fire Nation emblem on the doorflap. One of these
                soldiers has a patch over his left eye. They all notice the group and get
                up.</description>

      <description>Facial shot of Pipsqueak, still looming forward with a frown on his face.
                He suddenly starts laughing. The camera moves back, showing Aang and The Duke
                following suit. Pipsqueak pats the Avatar on the back in a friendly manner, though
                the hit was hard enough to knock Aang flat on the ground. The Duke stops laughing
                and looks down at Aang sprawled on the ground before his feet, face flat in the
                dirt, though when Aang raises his head and continues laughing, so does The
                Duke.</description>

      <description>The screen fades from the two of them alone on the suspension bridge to the
                blue sky above the canopy. A cloud of cawing birds is disturbed as Appa raises his
                head with a roar. In the hideout, ropes with lanterns hang between branches.
                Sentries keep watch on several upper platforms while the group sits at a banquet
                table. While the group eats, Jet stands on the table.</description>

      <speech speaker="Jet">Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine. <charAction>Everyone

                in the air.</charAction> Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don't have to worry about
            a couple of kids hiding in the trees. <charAction>He prepares to take a drink from his
                wooden cup.</charAction> Maybe they're right. <charAction>A very loud and long boo
                is heard; with an angry face.</charAction> Or maybe ... they're

      <description>The scene changes to the top of the forest the next day. Jet and Sokka are
                in branches of the same tree. Jet cups his hands and makes a birdcall; several trees
                down Pipsqueak and Smellerbee step into view from their branches. They reply with
                another birdcall. Sokka jams his jawbone knife into the trunk of the

      <description>Jet takes a step, and with one swipe, sends the man's cane flying from his
                hand. The old man backs away, but when he tries to flee the way he came, he runs
                face first into Pipsqueak's chest. The force of the impact knocks him to the ground;
                Pipsqueak looms over him. He tries to crawl away, but Pipsqueak's foot on his
                backside effectively pins him.</description>

      <description>Sokka slowly turns and runs to catch up with the others. At the hideout,

      <speech speaker="Aang">Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me! <charAction>Aang is wearing a bag and pulls a

                with a pop. Momo puffs up like a startled cat. He hisses and lunges for the bag.
                Momo sits on Aang's shoulder and tosses several pellets at his feet. Aang dances
                about wildly.</charAction> Ow! Quit it!</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Sokka is oblivious of it all. He's sitting with his back to the trunk and

      <description>Jet is sitting on a hammock-bed, the others stand. Sokka stands grumpily as
                far away as he can get. Aang is wearing the hat Katara made; he looks ridiculous and
                goofy.</description>

      <speech speaker="Jet">He was an assassin, Sokka.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Jet pulls out a knife and thrusts it into a nearby stump. It is a sinister
                looking curved blade. There are four spikes evenly spaced along the grip, with
                enough space for fingers to go between them. There is a ring on the butt of the
                knife.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife. <charAction>He pulls on the ring

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest. If you both use waterbending

            the whole valley.</speech>
   </section>

      <description>Aang and Katara look at each other. Fade to them entering their hut. Sokka
                is tying up a mat on the floor.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Sorry, Sokka.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They leave the hut. Fade to the night sky above the canopy. A full moon
                shines on Appa, who is on his back and snoring extremely loud as he sleeps. Inside
                the Trio's hut, Sokka sleeps propped up against his still-packed gear while the
                others sleep in their sleeping bags.</description>

      <speech speaker="Jet">Let's go.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Sokka wakes up. He pulls the door flap aside enough to see some of Jet's
                followers descending on the rope lines. Sokka grabs a rope line down to a lower
                branch. On the ground below him, Jet's Freedom Fighters are quietly pushing the
                loaded wagon as Jet leads them out of the camp. Sokka stealthily follows. In the
                dark valley. Upstream, and up toward the wall of the valley there is an old falls,
                and beyond that a man-made dam. A bare cliff off to the reservoir's left provides
                the view. Jet and his boys emerge from the forest. He goes to the edge and looks
                down on the dam below. The reservoir behind it is low. He turns back to the
                wagon.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">Now listen, you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal. If the reservoir
            isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive. <charAction>The Duke jumps off the
                wagon.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="The Duke">But what about the people in the town, won't they get wiped out too? <charAction>Jet
                places a hand on The Duke's shoulder.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation. <charAction>To
                Longshot.</charAction> Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal—got it?
                <charAction>Longshot nods.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka watches incredulously from the bushes. He frowns, and hears rustling
                just before Pipsqueak drags him out by his wolf-tail. Smellerbee's knife is
                instantly at his throat.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Jet, standing near the edge of the cliff. As he watches, Pipsqueak and
                Smellerbee drag Sokka between them. Pipsqueak still has a handful of Sokka's
                wolf-tail.</description>

      <speech speaker="Jet">Sokka, I'm glad you decided to join us. <charAction>Pipsqueak and Smellerbee send

   <section>
      <description>Pipsqueak and Smellerbee grab for Sokka. Before he can even react, Jet has
                his wrist pinned with the hooks of his shuang gou. Sokka's other hand is forced
                behind his back.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">I can't let you warn Katara and Aang. <charAction>Jet releases Sokka's hand; it is

   <section>
      <description>The screen pans to the riverside upriver from the dam. The collected water
                behind it is much less than the larger cavity of the reservoir. The river leading to
                down to it is a thread compared to its 'rainy season' gully. Jet, Katara, and Aang
                are seen walking upriver along its west bank.</description>

      <description>They are now walking in the gully, beside the 'river'. Aang pauses after

                he was standing on.</description>

      <description>Aang and Katara stand on one of the many geysers in the gully. While Jet
                looks on, they bend the water up. After a few minutes, a stream of water emerges
                from the hole. They pull it to their height and send it toward the river where it

      <description>The screen changes to a path in the forest. Pipsqueak and Smellerbee follow
                Sokka, who has his hands tied behind his back. Smellerbee gives Sokka a shove; Sokka
                stumbles but remains on his feet.</description>

      <speech speaker="Pipsqueak">Hey listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader. We follow what he says, and things always
            turn out okay. <charAction>Sokka notices a couple of snare leaf-piles nearby identical

      <speech speaker="Sokka">If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn. <charAction>Sokka sprints off

      <speech speaker="Smellerbee">Hey! <charAction>They give chase. Sokka leaps over the leaf piles. Pipsqueak and

      <description>Katara and Aang are standing on the edge of the cliff. At the base of the
                dam, four of Jet's people are unloading barrels from the wagon and arranging
                them.</description>

      <description>Before Aang can reach the edge, Jet crosses his path from behind and
                snatches the glider. Aang is left wobbling precariously on the edge, and uses
                airbending to get himself back on stable footing.</description>

      <description>Aang's closed glider is on the ground. As he reaches for it, one of Jet's
                hook swords pins it. Jet has the two swords hook to hook; with a yank he pulls
                Aang's glider to him.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Aang retreats back into the forest, as Jet hooks the branch and pulls
                himself up. Katara follows on the ground. Jet attacks; Aang defends himself with
                balls of air, which Jet ducks. Jet attacks head on, but Aang blocks with his arms
                and sends his opponent flying into a tree trunk with an air kick. Jet combines his
                swords again and advances. Aang avoids the flail-like move and sends another air
                blast. Jet stoops down and lets the air flow over and past him before
                lunging.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They continue the chase through the many levels of the forest. Jet catches
                up to Aang and sends them both freefalling, attacking as they go. They both end up
                on a branch. Jet continues his attack. Aang avoids it all. Jet charges again, but
                Aang hits him with a jetstream of air. Jet falls. He recovers, but loses the glider
                in the process. Before Aang can get to the ground Jet kicks him into a trunk. He
                lands with a thud next to his glider.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A small tributary flows past him. Aang is slow to get up. Before Jet can
                take more than a step however, he his hit by a large water strike. Katara is there;
                she uses water from the river to throw Jet against the trunk of the tree. Over and
                over she attacks; Jet is unable to cut the water and its force plasters him against
                the trunk. She freezes Jet from toe to neck.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me, you're sick and I trusted
            you! <charAction>A birdcall is heard. Katara and Aang are startled, and look to the
                valley beyond where it's coming from. Jet gives an answering birdcall.</charAction>

      <description>The center of the dam explodes in a cloud of smoke and fire. Katara and
                Aang watch a massive wall of water go to the town. Inside the town the streets are
                empty except for the occasional barrels and the Cabbage Merchant's cabbage cart. The
                water rushes through the open gate, as a cresting wave dwarfs it. The wall and gate
                are swallowed as the wave strikes the town. The flotsam carried away includes a
                smiling doll in a purple dress.</description>

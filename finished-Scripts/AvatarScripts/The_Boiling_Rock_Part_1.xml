      <description>The scene opens to the Western Air Temple at nightfall. Zuko is pouring tea
                to give to the members of Team Avatar.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Cut to a tray full of tea cups with Zuko's hand holding a kettle and
                filling up the empty cups.</charAction> No one can make tea like Uncle
                <charAction>Camera pans up to Zuko's face.</charAction>, but hopefully I learned a
            thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Sure. <charAction>Cut to an overhead of the group sitting around a
                fire.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I like jokes.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Bring it!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Okay. <charAction>Serves tea to The Duke and Haru and stands up with his
                tray.</charAction> Well, I can't remember how it starts, but the punch line
                <charAction>The boys help themselves to the tea.</charAction> is "Leaf me alone, I'm
            bushed!" <charAction>No response.</charAction> Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells
            it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Everyone else laughs. Zuko smiles a little.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">It's nice to get a chance to relax a little. It hardly ever happens.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko hands tea to Teo and Toph. He subsequently approaches
                Sokka.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hey, can I talk to you for a second? <charAction>Stands up and walks
                out.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko sets down the tray of tea. The camera switches to a shot of him and
                Sokka walking away from where the rest of the group is gathered.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">So, what's up? <charAction>Appa wakes up and looks as they walk past
                him.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">What do you mean? Who was captured?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know
            where they might be.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I can't tell you.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">What? Why not?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse. <charAction>Turns to leave, but is
                stopped by Sokka.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">It's my dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him through.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">It's not good, Sokka.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Please.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">My guess is, they were taken to the Boiling Rock.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">What's that?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">The highest security prison in the Fire Nation. <charAction>Sokka looks at him,
                horrified.</charAction> It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake. It's
            inescapable.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">So, where is this place?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Why do you need to know? What are you planning?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Nothing. <charAction>Pauses for a moment.</charAction> Boy, you're so
            paranoid.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually
            flew right past it on your way here.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Thanks, Zuko. <charAction>Yawns.</charAction> Just knowing makes me feel
            better.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Yeah, I'm sure it does.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Fade to later that night. With everyone asleep, Sokka sneaks away from
                everyone. He sighs and almost steps on Momo, narrowly avoiding tripping over him and
                waking him up. He climbs onto Appa, who awakes.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>To Appa.</charAction> Shhh.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa goes back to sleep, as Sokka climbs on top of him. However, as he
                climbs up, he notices Zuko is already in the saddle with his arms
                crossed.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Not up to anything, huh?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Falls off Appa, his bag's contents fall out.</charAction> Fine, you
            caught me. I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I'm never happy.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Picking up the fallen items.</charAction> Look, I have to do this. The
            invasion plan was my idea, it was my decision to stay when things were going wrong.
                <charAction>Zuko jumps off of Appa.</charAction> It's my mistake, and it's my job to
            fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko. <charAction>Pushes Zuko
                aside and begins to climb up Appa on Appa's saddle.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">No. I have to do this alone.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked, prisons don't have
            bison daycares. <charAction>Sokka stops climbing, sighs, and looks back at
                Zuko.</charAction> We'll take my war balloon. <charAction>They walk off to the war
                balloon.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Appa and Momo, still sleeping at sunrise. The Duke gives Appa some
                hay. Katara notices that Momo is holding a note.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">What does it say?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">"Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko." <charAction>As she
                says this, Aang yawns and turns around to lie back down.</charAction> One more
            thing. "Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and
            ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko."</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A badgerfrog croaks, waking Aang from his rest.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Sighs.</charAction> Nobody else has homework. <charAction>Stands up and
                walks to a spot and starts hot squatting while Katara and Toph walk
                away.</charAction> One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat
            ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Scene cuts to Zuko and Sokka in the air in the war balloon. Zuko blasts
                fire into the tank to keep it moving. A moment of awkward silence between the two
                follows.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Pretty clouds.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Yeah ... fluffy. <charAction>Sokka whistles.</charAction> What?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these
            war balloons.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">No kidding.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Yep, a balloon ... but for war.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">If there's one thing my dad's good at, it's war. <charAction>Blasts more fire into
                the tank.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Yeah, it seems to run in the family.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Looks at Sokka, defensively.</charAction> Hey, hold on. Not everyone in
            my family is like that.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I know, I know, you've changed.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Downcast.</charAction> I meant my uncle. He was more of a father to me.
            And I really let him down.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's
            hard.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">It wasn't that hard.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Well, I did have a girlfriend. Mai.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Smiles and looks at Zuko with interest.</charAction> That gloomy girl
            who sighs a lot?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Smiles.</charAction> Yeah. Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a
            traitor. I couldn't drag her into it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">My first girlfriend turned into the moon.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Shocked for a moment. Looks up at the sky briefly, before glancing back
                at Sokka.</charAction> That's rough, buddy.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Nightfall. Sokka is asleep, snoring loudly. Zuko continues to keep the tank
                full. He stops to look out in the distance.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">There it is! <charAction>Sokka awakens to see it.</charAction> There's plenty of
            steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet, we should be able to navigate through
            it without being caught.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>As they enter the volcano's steam, the balloon begins losing altitude
                quickly.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Frantically blasting fire into the tank.</charAction> We're going down!
            The balloon's not working anymore! <charAction>Blasts fire up into the
                balloon.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Falls to the side as the balloon tips.</charAction> So what are we
            supposed to do?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I don't know! Crash-landing?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The balloon skids along the boiling water, splashing Sokka's hand, which he
                shakes while blocking his mouth to prevent himself from screaming. The balloon hits
                the base of the rock, ejecting the two from it.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Looking at the destroyed war balloon.</charAction> How are we gonna get
            off the island if the balloon won't work?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">We'll figure something out! I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Walks to the destroyed balloon.</charAction> My dad might be here! I had
            to come and see!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Uncle always said I never thought things through. But this ... this is just
            crazy!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Gathers parts from the balloon together.</charAction> Hey, I never
            wanted you to come along in the first place! And for the record, I always think things
            through! But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear. So
            there. <charAction>After the hot water on the balloon burns his hand, Sokka kicks it
                into the water.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">What are you doing?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I hope you know what you're doing. <charAction>They both turn to look at the
                prison.</charAction> There's no turning back now.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Morning. Zuko and Sokka have entered the prison, and come out of a supply
                room filled with reserve guard uniforms. Both of them wear prison guard
                uniforms.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A series of guards run by. One of them runs back and looks at
                them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Male guard">Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard. Come on.</speech>
   </section>

      <description>The two go to the yard. Prisoners are gathered in a circle as the guards
                move through to the inside.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bully guard">He wants to know what he did. <charAction>To Zuko and Sokka.</charAction> Isn't that

   <section>
      <description>The bully guard walks away, but as he is leaving, he whips fire at Chit
                Sang. Chit Sang blocks it, and redirects it at him. The bully guard breaks the blast
                with a kick.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bully guard">Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited. You're going in the cooler.

   <section>
      <description>Meal time for the guards. Zuko is getting food, noticeably the only guard
                wearing a helmet.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Male guard">Hey, new guy! I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times, but this is
            the lounge. Relax.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared, someone could strike me on the

      <speech speaker="Male guard">Trust me, you don't want to. <charAction>The female guard throws a cup at him, which

      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous
            criminals, right? <charAction>The other guards nod.</charAction> So what about war
            prisoners?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>In the yard, the warden arrives on the gondolas. Meanwhile, Sokka and the
                bully guard continue to stand guard by the cooler. Sokka is looking inside at Chit
                Sang who is shivering.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">It sure looks cold in there.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bully guard">That's why we call it the cooler. He won't be firebending there. <charAction>Notices
                someone coming; lowers his mask.</charAction> It's the warden! <charAction>He and
                Sokka stand to attention.</charAction> Look alive!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Warden">

                now rapidly blinking pink hearts, while Zuko gives him a conspicuous look. Sokka
                does not pay attention and lowers the visor of his helmet with a smile before
                dashing out of the scene with a surprised Zuko quicking turning his head and looking
                after him. Cut to the prisoners' housing area. Camera slowly pans to show a guard
                mopping the floor and another one doing his rounds. Cut to Suki lying on her bed and
                staring at the ceiling in sadness. The door to her cell opens and closes,
                illuminating her face as her eyes turn to the door. Cut to a further off side-shot

                head on his shoulder, and he mellows into the embrace, returning it in all honestly
                while closing his eyes. Cut to a close-up side-shot of Suki, who is tearing up out

                Suki throws her arms around Sokka's neck. Cut to a close-up frontal shot of Zuko
                standing guard outside the cell. He suddenly looks to his right. Cut to a further
                off shot, showing the entire hallway, revealing that the sound that drew Zuko's
                attention was a guard ascending nearby stairs. He taps on the cell door to get Sokka
                and Suki's attention. Cut to inside the cell where the couple stops kissing, Sokka
                casting a suspicious look to the door. Cut back to outside the cell, where the
                female guard approaches Zuko, who is standing in front of the cell door, his arms

                can touch him, he grabs hold of the arm and turns her around, slamming her face

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She turns to retaliate against Zuko's action. Cut to inside the cell, where
                Zuko's head can be seen through the looking hole as he is slammed against the door.
                The camera pans down to show Sokka and Suki pushed against the door, looking up in
                worry. Sokka's expression turns serious as he lowers his gaze and puts on his
                helmet. Cut to a close-up shot of the guard's right calf as Zuko plants his own leg
                behind it. Switch to a further off shot. Zuko grabs a hold of the woman's right arm
                and forces her to bend backward, thus averting her sight from the door that slides
                open. Sokka quickly exits the cell and shuffles away, his back pressed against the
                wall. The female guard manages to push Zuko's face up with her left arm, regaining a
                more leveled pose herself. Cut to a close-up side-shot of her from underneath Zuko's

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the

                Sokka and Zuko until they hear them above, rolling the, now detached, cooler down

         <charAction>Turns to Zuko.</charAction> If I had just cut my losses at the invasion,
            maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits

      <description>As morning arrives, the cooler holding Chit Sang, his buddy, and his
                girlfriend is still within the perimeter of the prison. The current escapees are
                sweating as the cooler slowly floats with the current.</description>

      <speech speaker="Chit Sang">Aah, this current is so slow. I can use this to paddle. <charAction>Rips off a piece
                of the cooler. When he puts the piece of metal in the water, the steaming water
                splashes on to his hand, causing him to scream loudly.</charAction>

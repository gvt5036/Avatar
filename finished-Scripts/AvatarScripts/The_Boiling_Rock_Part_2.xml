                stronghold lies ahead. Cut to view of the warden walking forward, toward the

      <description>Cut to an overhead shot of the perimeter on which they are standing, the
                warden's back facing the camera. Eight prisoners are seen filing in line, one next
                to the other, including Hakoda. Cut to the end of the line of prisoners where the
                last of them line up, the camera zooming out to show Hakoda, who stands at the very
                end of the line on the right side. Cut to Sokka, who walks forward and lifts his
                guard mask.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">Dad ... <charAction>Exiting a stairway and passing through a lineup of guards,
                surprising them a bit.</charAction> Excuse me, coming through. The warden wants me

   <section>
      <description>Cut to overhead shot of the perimeter, the prisoners lined up toward the
                right and the guards to the left of the screen. Sokka is seen inching his way behind
                several guards, taller than him. The warden approaches the new
                prisoners.</description>

      <speech speaker="Warden">
         <charAction>Walking past the line of prisoners starting from the left.</charAction>
            Welcome to the Boiling Rock. I'm sure you've all heard the horrible rumors about our
            little island. Well, I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true, as long as
            you do everything I say. <charAction>He stops in front of Hakoda who looks downward;
                looks closer at Hakoda.</charAction> Look me in the eye when I'm talking to
            you.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Hakoda">
         <charAction>Averting his gaze slightly off to the side; firmly.</charAction>
            No.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Warden">Oh? You'd rather look at my shoes? <charAction>Angrily.</charAction> Then take a
            look!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He raises his left leg and drags Hakoda by his handcuffs down onto the
                floor. Cut to a side-view of Hakoda kneeling over, his face expressing anger. Cut to
                Sokka standing behind two guards as he gasps in horror. Cut to shot from below
                Hakoda, where the warden stands over him, keeping his foot firmly pressed on the
                warrior's handcuffs.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Warden">I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong-willed.
                <charAction>Cut to the warden's face.</charAction> But don't worry, we'll get rid of
            that in time. Now look me in the eye!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Hakoda reluctantly lifts his head to look the warden in the eye and glares
                hatefully at him.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Warden">
         <charAction>Calmer.</charAction> See, isn't that better? <charAction>To the other
                prisoners.</charAction> You will all do as I say or pay the price. You will
            all-</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He begins to walk forward only for Hakoda to lift his left handcuff
                slightly, tripping the warden and causing him to fall flat on the ground. Sokka
                stifles a chuckle, as the two guards he was standing behind rush to aid the
                warden.</description>

   <section>
      <description>He storms away impatiently. The two guards look at each other. Cut to
                wide-view of the perimeter where the prisoners file one behind the other and are led
                down a stairwell into what is presumed to be the prison hold. Sokka runs away
                off-screen. Cut to inside the prison, followed by an overhead shot of inside
                Hakoda's cell, where he sits on his mattress, his face buried in his arms. A sliver
                of light appears as the doorway to the cell is opened. Hakoda raises his head to see
                who has entered. Cut to side-view of the entire cell, revealing that Sokka has
                walked in, still dressed as a guard.</description>

      <speech speaker="Hakoda">
         <charAction>Rises to his feet and extends his right arm out, clenched in a fist, not
                realizing the guard is his son in disguise; Sokka backs up a bit.</charAction> If

                <charAction>Amused.</charAction> You know Sokka, you should be more careful with

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Rubs the back of his neck sheepishly.</charAction> Yeah, I ran into that

   <section>
      <description>Cut to a dimly-lit corridor. Cut to view of a door as it slides open,
                revealing Chit Sang sitting inside an interrogation room, cuffed to a wooden chair.
                The warden walks on-screen into the room. Cut to an overhead shot of the
                interrogation room as he approaches the prisoner.</description>

         <charAction>Snaps.</charAction> If you're trying to get me to talk, forget it!
                <charAction>The warden appears behind him.</charAction> I'm not a squealer!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Warden">
         <charAction>Cuts to close-up of his face; casually.</charAction> Chit Sang, I only

      <speech speaker="Chit Sang">
         <charAction>Brightly.</charAction> Well, yeah, actually I am pretty
            comfortable.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The warden, in a fit of anger, kicks the chair to the ground. Chit Sang
                falls forward off screen. Cuts to shot of him lying on the floor, still bound to the
                chair, his face pressed against the ground. The warden walks up to Chit
                Sang.</description>

      <speech speaker="Warden">I know you and your cronies are not smart enough to come up with that little escape

            who is?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The warden exits the room. Cut to view of the room, as the two guards hoist
                the chair upward and set it on the ground. The guard on Chit Sang's left walks over
                to the doorway and slides the door to the cell closed. Cut to shot of the prison
                courtyard. Cut to shot of outside Hakoda's cell where Sokka can be seen looking
                through the open slit in the cell door, averting his eyes in different
                directions.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Hakoda">The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me
            out as their leader and sent me here. <charAction>Sokka comes by his father and sits
                down.</charAction> But before I left, I met some young women who said they knew you.

            problem.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Actually, he's on our side now. <charAction>Cut to Hakoda, who gives his son a
                suspicious look.</charAction> I know. I had the same reaction. After all he's done,
            it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you
            without his help. <charAction>Hakoda nods his head at Sokka, indicating that he
                understands.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Hakoda">So, do you have a plan?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Downcast.</charAction> We had one, but some of the other prisoners got
            involved and ruined it. <charAction>Leans forward and rests his face in his
                arms.</charAction> I dunno if there's another way off this island.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Hakoda">
         <charAction>Smiles and pats a hand on Sokka's back.</charAction> Sokka, there's no
            prison in the world that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Then we'd better find two.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Hakoda laughs. Sokka chuckles nervously. Cut to a ground level shot of
                inside the prison hold. Sokka approaches a cell door and averts his gaze alertly. He
                lifts his helmet mask and peers into the slit of a cell doorway.</description>

      <description>Sokka turns around, pulling down his helmet mask. The camera shifts to
                reveal two guards standing on the stairwell behind him. Cut to shot from in between

      <speech speaker="Sokka">

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Female guard">

   <section>
      <description>The two guards fold their arms. Sokka enters the cell and begins to "rough
                up" Zuko. The female guard leans against the wall, crosses her arms and shakes her
                head in mock disapproval.</description>

                landed to it. Cut to shot of the cell where Sokka is seen punching the mattress
                which Zuko holds up, the two faking the entire scenario. Zuko shouts a few times in
                mock pain.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>In a hushed voice while still punching the mattress.</charAction> We
            have a new plan, but it's gonna need a big distraction. <charAction>Cuts to shot of Zuko
                who peers from behind the blanket; off camera.</charAction> Be in the yard in one
            hour.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A sliver of light appears as the cell door is opened. Sokka suddenly grabs
                Zuko and begins to wrestle him to look convincing as the two guards
                enter.</description>

            the mastermind. He came up with the plan.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The warden smiles slyly, pats Chit Sang on the head, and exits. The camera
                focuses on Chit Sang, who maintains a cold-hard expression. The scene changes to the
                prison cell where Zuko sits in the chair slumped over and Mai stands over

            I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up. <charAction>Walks over to the

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">My dad and I came up with the plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola

         <charAction>Takes his hands off her shoulders.</charAction> We'll never make it onto

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're
            gonna start a prison riot.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Okay, let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The
            warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Not if the warden is the captive. <charAction>Nearby noise occurs. Moves to look

            find you before we start the riot. <charAction>Cut to outside the cell, where he slides

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you
            ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says. <charAction>Places his

      <description>The guard opens all the doors by pulling the levers. The prisoners head for
                the yard. The prisoners mingle in the yard, where Sokka, Suki, and Hakoda
                meet.</description>

            let's riot! <charAction>He is taken down by another prisoner. The riot is in full swing.
                Cut the floor of the yard as chaos and dust ensues everywhere. Cut to a prisoner
                sitting on another prisoner's shoulders, attempting to choke him. Cut to the bottom
                of a tower as various guards look down at the scene.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Warden">Who let these prisoners into the yard? <charAction>Cut to the warden on a

   <section>
      <description>The door guard, who was in charge of the control room, raises his visor and
                looks at the warden, horrified. He puts his back against the wall and sneaks away by
                quickly tip-toeing and ducks to a corner. The camera cuts back to Zuko and
                Mai.</description>

      <description>Zuko blasts fire at the guard and starts to run toward the door. The guard

   <section>
      <description>Exiting, Zuko closes and locks the door, trapping Mai and the guard in the
                room. He looks at Mai through the slit in the door with regret, while she stares
                back in anger, before running off to join his friends. Back in the yard, he reaches
                everyone else and slams down another guard as the riot continues.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">Zuko! Good, we're all here. Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the

      <description>Sokka peeks out and looks amazed as he sees Suki hop up on the heads of the
                rioters before jumping and flipping onto the tower. She easily defeats the first
                guard with a few quick jabs. Two more guards arrive. She ducks a fire blast and
                sweeps the first one, promptly dodges the second one's fire blast, and continues to
                climb the tower. She makes it up to the top and defeats the final guard with a
                sliding kick. She soon grabs the warden, threatening him with her fist in front of
                his face.</description>

      <description>They continue along their path, cautiously watching the guards so they do

      <description>Looking up at the retreating gondola, Azula suddenly snatches a pair of
                handcuffs from a guard's belt and runs forward. Behind her, Ty Lee jumps up and onto
                the cable, running along it toward the gondola. After elevating herself to the line
                with a fire blast, Azula uses the cuffs to attach herself to the cable and propel
                herself forwaard. The occupants of the gondola watch as they approach, Suki looking
                very grim.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Sokka, Suki, and Zuko climb to the top of the gondola to meet Azula and Ty
                Lee. Ty Lee flips into the air and lands in front of Suki, who growls and assumes a
                battle-ready position. Azula pulls herself up onto the roof and faces Zuko and
                Sokka. An overhead shot shows them all standing atop the gondola before closing in
                on Azula again. The Fire Nation princess assumes a battle stance and performs a
                slicing kick, sending blue fire at her opponents, but Zuko blocks it. Ty Lee and
                Suki trade blows, the latter blocking the former's attempts to use chi blocking each
                time. Ty Lee is forced to the edge but jumps into the gondola and comes out the
                other side, continuing her attacks. Zuko continues to wipe out Azula's fire blasts.
                Sokka draws her back to the edge with his sword. Zuko goes in for a finish, but
                Azula dodges Zuko's blast and stays on the gondola. She counters with a blast that
                goes wide, almost striking Suki and Ty Lee, who barely manage to dodge it.
                Meanwhile, the warden attempts to free himself while the other prisoners are
                distracted. A male guard watches from a telescope.</description>

      <description>The guards stop the gondola by jamming the mechanism with metal bars; the
                wheel screeches angrily as it grinds to a halt. The gondola rocks back and forth
                from the sudden stop, disrupting the combatants from their respective duels. Losing
                his balance, Sokka slides to the edge of the gondola, but Zuko pulls him in at the
                last moment. Ty Lee jumps up to the top of the wire to see what is
                happening.</description>

      <description>The guards work to cut the line. Azula notices another gondola approaching
                on the other wire, heading inbound.</description>

            gondola.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <description>Ty Lee backflips to the other gondola. When she reaches it, she looks back
                at Sokka, Suki, and Zuko with concern, in contrast to Azula's sadistic smile. The
                other three jump back into the gondola.</description>

      <description>Pan down to the Boiling Lake. The line is almost entirely severed by now,
                but before the guards can finish the job, they are suddenly yanked away from it and
                pinned to the wall by stilettos.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Other guards try to attack Mai, but she dodges all their fire blasts and
                retaliates with her knives, pinning them all down by their wristguards. Mai rears up
                in front of a female guard, who stops in fear, and deploys four knives that send the
                two guards behind her flying, dislodging one of the bars jamming the wheel
                mechanism. She pulls out her three-pronged sai and pins down the last guard.
                Releasing the block on the line, she allows the gondola to continue in motion.
                Everyone looks back to see what happened.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Ty Lee shrugs and makes a small sound as they watch her continue to fight
                off guards, all of whom are helpless against her. The gondola makes it to the top of
                the hill. Everyone leaves. Chit Sang holds the warden and throws him back in when
                Hakoda points at it.</description>

      <description>Back at the prison. Mai is detained by two guards, while Azula glares at
                her. Ty Lee stands in the middle, looking terrified and concerned at the
                two.</description>

                looks from one to the other, tears in her eyes, and back to Azula.</charAction> The
            thing I don't understand is "Why?". Why would you do it? You know the
            consequences.</speech>

      <description>Azula angles her fingers to create lightning, and Mai readies one of her
                stilettos, her eyes narrowed. Before Azula can complete her attack, however, she is
                struck twice by Ty Lee, who chi blocks her. Cuts to Mai, blade still in hand and
                looking very surprised, and to Azula, who dumbfoundedly falls to the ground,
                paralyzed. Ty Lee seems surprised at her own actions.</description>

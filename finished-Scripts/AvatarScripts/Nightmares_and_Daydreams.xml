      <description>Some koala sheep are sleeping, as Katara, Sokka, Aang, Toph, and Appa come
                out of the bushes. Sokka looks at a map, while everyone else looks around. Momo
                jumps over on Aang's shoulder, as Aang scratches his head.</description>

         <charAction>Somewhat excitedly.</charAction> This is it! The official rendezvous

      <description>The camera pans to the left, showing a vast area of the

      <speech speaker="Toph">How did you pick this place?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map. It's uninhabited, and
            the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Nice choice, Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule.</speech>

         <charAction>Anxiously.</charAction> Wait! Four days? The invasion's in

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Yawns.</charAction> Whatever. That's like four days from now. Let's just

      <description>Sokka falls asleep and begins snoring.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Sokka's got the right idea, Aang. We're here. We're ready. The best thing we can do
            now is get plenty of rest. <charAction>Lies down.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Half-heartedly.</charAction> I guess.</speech>
   </section>
      <section>
         <description>Everyone else falls asleep. Aang lies down and, as he closes his eyes,
                    the camera zooms in on his face.</description>
      </section>
      <section>
         <description>Scene briefly fades to black before changing to a large Fire Nation
                    insignia, which is revealed to be a door when the camera zooms back. The door
                    busts open, revealing a boy with large hair, a headband, and a yellow jump suit,
                    with his face turned the other side. He enters the room with a series of
                    dramatic gestures. It is revealed that this boy is Aang in strange attire. Aang
                    quickly jumps on to a rock tower. Cut to wider shot of Aang standing on the rock
                    tower, surrounded by floating broken pillars.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>He makes some fast and dramatic ninja-like moves as he
                speaks.</charAction> Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord! I'm bringing you
            down.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to close-up of the Fire Lord, who is about to take a bite of a bundle
                of grapes with his eyes closed. Hearing Aang's words, he stops and opens his eyes to
                look down at his adversary. The camera pans out quickly to reveal he is actually a
                giant when compared to Aang and surrounded by a pit of fire.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ozai">Really? <charAction>Brings his face close to Aang.</charAction> How do you plan on
            doing that when you're not even wearing pants?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Aang's scared face, as he looks down to see that Ozai was telling
                the truth, and screams.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Oh no!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang quickly covers himself with a white Air Nomad shield pulled out of
                thin air. The camera zooms out to a larger shot of Aang shaking with embarrassment.
                Suddenly, giant eyes begin to appear all around him. The eye's close and disappear.
                Cut to shot of the giant Fire Lord laughing, as Aang slowly backs out the door. The
                Fire Lord raises his arms to the ceiling, while surrounded by flames, laughing
                heartily. Aang wakes up and starts touching his pants. Momo is seen awake as
                well.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">It was just a dream, Momo. I still have my pants. <charAction>Stands
                up.</charAction> Well, I better keep training.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang walks over to a bush and starts kicking it. Momo gets bored of
                watching him, and soon falls back asleep. Scene changes to the Fire Nation Palace,
                where Zuko is getting dressed and ready, with help from his servants.</description>

      <speech speaker="Servant #2">Hot towel?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko looks at the towels for a moment and takes one. He is seen wiping his
                forehead before walking out of the room. The two servants bow behind him. Zuko walks
                out the palace gates, with Fire Nation citizens waiting for him. One woman becomes
                overly excited at seeing Zuko, and is taken away by the palace guards.</description>

      <speech speaker="Servant #1">Prince Zuko, is something wrong? You didn't take the palanquin.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I'm just going to Mai's house. It's not far.</speech>

      <section>
         <description>Zuko looks to the distance, walks over, and gets into the palanquin.
                    The servants pick it up and walk over to Mai's house. Zuko looks out of the
                    palanquin's curtains and sees Mai, who is standing by the doors to her house,
                    who waves and walks away.</description>
      </section>
      <section>
         <description>The scene changes back to Aang, who is still training. He is now
                    banging his fists against a tree, which wakes up Sokka, Toph, and Katara. Katara
                    looks at Sokka, who just shrugs. She decides to go talk to Aang about
                    this.</description>
      </section>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Hey. How long have you been up?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">A couple hours. I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Aang stops, panting.</charAction> You know, there is such a thing as
            over-training.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang hits the tree one last time, which sends a vibration throughout his
                body and makes him fall down, with all of the leaves off the tree collapsing on him.
                Katara just gazes down at him, and Sokka, holding his map, and Toph, who is facing
                the other direction, look out from behind her. Aang comes out from under the leaves
                and walks around Katara in a fighting stance.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">You don't get it, do you? My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any
            firebending. Not even the basics.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang's left eye twitches a little bit after saying this. Katara brings
                Aang's hand down, with a forced smile on her face. Sokka is seen, lying down, still
                looking at the map.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">That's okay, Aang. The eclipse will block off firebending anyway. You don't need to
            know it. <charAction>Looking at Aang.</charAction> Plus, it's a stupid element.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Okay, well I still have to work on everything else. I better spend the whole day
            training.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang bows quickly toward Sokka, followed by Katara, and rides off on an air
                scooter. Sokka moves the map up in front of his face to hide behind it. The view
                changes to the blue sky, which changes to a starry night. Aang is walking back from
                his training, now exhausted. Everyone else is asleep. Aang rubs his eyes and yawns
                before collapsing.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Aang, who flinched upon hearing Toph, but goes back into his normal
                position and closes his eyes. The camera pans up.</description>
      <section>
         <description>The scene fades briefly to black again, before cutting to shot of Aang
                    busting through the same large Fire Nation door from his previous dream. This
                    time, he is wearing boats, white pants, a high collared yellow tunic that covers
                    his mouth, white sleeves with blue arrows on them, and has his chest wrapped in
                    a chain. He has sideburns, his hair is long and stands up straight, wears his
                    headband, and has two small metal rings in the top of his right ear. As he
                    stands in the opening where the doors once were, he snaps his fingers and smoke
                    starts to pour into the entrance. Aang slides in and jumps over some small
                    pillars to face Ozai, who is still a giant.</description>

                <charAction>Looks down momentarily; confidently.</charAction> And this time, I
            brought pants.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Camera shows a view of some chains wrapping around Aang's clothing,
                including his pants. The shot turns to Ozai.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ozai">So it seems, but are you prepared for your ... mathematics test?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A giant abacus lands behind Aang. Camera turns to show Aang's worried
                face.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Math test? Oh no! I forgot all about the math test!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Ozai is heard laughing in the background as Aang is screaming while being
                pulled backward and crushed by some beads on the abacus. He suddenly wakes
                up.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I've gotta be ready.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang gets up and walks away. He is seen pacing around some sleeping koala
                sheep. Katara comes over to talk to him.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Aang">But I forgot my pants and my math test.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Aang, sleep. Please. For me.</speech>

      <section>
         <description>Aang looks at her, rubbing his eyes. He bows his head, and the two walk
                    back. A koala sheep makes a sound. The scene changes to the Royal Palace, where
                    Zuko and Mai are relaxing on a couch.</description>

      <speech speaker="Mai">I guess there's some nice perks that come with being royalty. <charAction>Pushing
                him Zuko to lay down with her.</charAction> Though there's annoying stuff, too. Like

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Sitting up, followed by Mai.</charAction> War meeting? What are you

      <speech speaker="Zuko">I guess I wasn't invited.</speech>

      <description>The two look away from each other. The scene changes back to the Black
                Cliffs, where Aang is still sleeping.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ozai">Wake up, Aang. Wake up, sleepy head! <charAction>Cut to an out of focus swaying shot
                of the Fire Lord standing over Aang.</charAction> Rise and shine! You overslept.
                <charAction>The Fire Lord bends in close and then even closer.</charAction> You
            missed the invasion.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Ozai begins to laugh, and is seen riding a giant, flying hippo cow, which
                breathes out fire at Aang, making him move from his spot. He watches as Ozai flies
                away, still laughing. Aang quickly wakes up, and goes to wake up
                Sokka.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Sokka, get up! I needa know what day it is!</speech>

      <description>Sokka grabs his sword and jumps up, but hits his head on a nearby rock and

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb
            this cliff, <charAction>Camera turns to show an annoyed look on Sokka's

      <description>Sokka stands up quickly and steps in front of Aang.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Camera turns to show the size of the cliff. When it sets back on Sokka, he
                looks at Aang, pointing to the cliff. Aang nods fast, and Sokka reluctantly begins
                to climb it.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Stupid Avatar! Stupid cliff! Stupid dream! I can climb fast!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang is seen looking up at Sokka with an anxious smile, before frowning at
                seeing how slowly he was going. Toph tries to get a drink of water.</description>

      <description>Sokka is seen behind Aang falling off the cliff after hearing Aang. Toph
                spits out the water onto Katara, who waterbends it off her.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use

   <section>
      <description>Sokka is still climbing the cliff, and almost reaches the top, but is seen
                sliding down. Cut to the sun in the sky. Cut to Aang's face, his eye twitching, as
                he paces around, stressed. Cut to his hands rotating between putting his thumb and
                finger together before alternating to the opposites on the other hand.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed.
            I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>As he paces, Katara sits, concerned, petting Momo and watching Aang, while
                Sokka hammers away at a piece of armor for Appa. Toph lies resting against a
                sleeping Appa.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Sokka, Katara, and Toph stretch and yawn before lying down. Aang slowly
                lies down, and closes his eyes, leading to another dream. It begins with a
                thunderstorm, with Aang riding on Appa through it. They fly by a giant Momo, who
                tries hitting them down, and grabs them in his hand. It changes to an image of the
                Fire Nation Royal Palace, and Aang emerges in the water, and is pushed forward into
                the palace. He looks in all directions, waiting for something to happen. Toph is
                seen rotating around. Her bangs move to reveal that her eyes are blank. She falls
                down under the floor in front of Aang, who becomes scared. Sokka tries running away,
                but some wet earth closes around him. Katara is seen surrounded by fire. Aang tries
                to go save her, but his feet are frozen to the ground. Ice crawls up his body, and
                he reaches out, but he's completely frozen. The ground that he was on becomes
                completely ice. Ozai, as a fire monster, begins laughing and melts the ice, which
                makes Aang fall down. He is released from his form and falls into some water, where
                he sinks to the bottom and looks through the floor, seeing Zuko as if he was
                standing above. The comet is seen passing by behind Zuko. Aang is seen still holding
                his breath. The comet is shown rushing down. Momo is seen telling someone to be
                quiet. Aang is standing on grass and seeing bushes and mountains when the comet
                strikes the ground, and everything is scorched and on fire. He quickly wakes up,
                screaming and waking everyone else up. Appa becomes scared, and Momo slides off him.
                Everyone rushes over to him.</description>

      <description>Aang starts shaking upon this, and everyone behind him is shocked, except
                for Toph, who just smiles. Sokka's Wang Fire disguise falls off him. The scene
                changes to the next day, where Katara is doing some exercises on the edge of the
                cliff. Aang is pacing nervously behind her, which makes her stop.</description>

      <description>Sokka looks in the direction Aang was pointing. Momo is seen in a purple
                samurai outfit with the fur between his ears tied in a topknot. Appa is seen with
                orange and dark red armor and a helmet, with three swords. Momo takes out his one
                sword, and the two charge at each other. Momo parries Appa's three swords with his
                single one. Some koala sheep start cheering on the two.</description>

      <description>Appa takes out another sword, and twists in a twister toward Momo, who
                blocks the attacks. Aang walks forward and tries stopping them.</description>

      <description>Aang begins sweating. Rocks, in a snake like formation, begin to slide in
                and around Aang, before sliding away. The koala sheep continue cheering on Momo and
                Appa. The tree with Ozai's noodle picture begins dancing. A ring of rocks surrounds
                Aang, as do the koala sheep. Three lines of rocks are seen on each side of Aang, as
                Momo and Appa continue to fight.</description>

                A mist of fog surrounds koala sheep wool. Aang looks at it and begins touching

                bed, where he lies down.</charAction> You know what? I think I am ready.
                <charAction>The other three watch as he falls asleep quickly. He falls into another

      <description>The view goes outside, where it is seen that the palace is up on a rock in
                the sky. The scene fades back to the Black Cliffs with Ozai screaming to Aang, who
                is seen smiling upon his success in the dream. Fade to credits.</description>

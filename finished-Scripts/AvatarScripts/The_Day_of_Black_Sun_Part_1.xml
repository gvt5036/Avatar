      <description>The episode starts in the Black Cliffs, with the scene cutting to a shot of
                three maps lying splayed out on the ground. Cut to Sokka who ponders over the maps
                intensely. He closes his eyes and rubs his forehead, seemingly confused. Two gloved
                hands suddenly appear, one holding a cup and the other moving Sokka's hand aside
                from his forehead to hand him the cup. The hand comes to rest on his shoulders
                comfortingly. Cut to zoomed out shot of Sokka sitting by a cliff-edge, the maps laid
                out before him. Katara is kneeling right beside him, having been the one to hand him
                the cup. Toph can be seen in the background, sitting idly on a rock. Aang suddenly
                appears on-screen, leaping into the air and landing beside Toph.</description>

                side-view of him, the camera panning slightly to the left.</charAction> When Azula
            shot me with lightning, <charAction>Close his eyes briefly.</charAction> my seventh
            chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the universe.

                telescope; Bato stands in the background. Hakoda lowers the telescope and smiles
                confidently. Scene fades to shot of the shoreline where Aang and Toph stand in the
                background by the water. They utilize earthbending to raise rock from beneath the
                water and form a dock. Cut to overhead shot of the Black Cliffs to show four Water
                Tribe ships already docked. The last Water Tribe ship is seen coming into port. Cut

                themselves. A pair of legs appears on screen, boasting Earth Kingdom clothing. A

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She is lifted off the ground by two big arms. The camera shows that the
                arms actually belong to the Big Bad Hippo, a former competitor at Earth Rumble VI.
                He is joined by the Boulder, another former competitor. The Hippo hugs
                Toph.</description>

      <description>The camera cuts to Sokka, while The Hippo puts Toph down. He turns to his
                dad. Suddenly, a bomb explodes on a boat, making Sokka, Hakoda, and Aang run toward
                it. The mechanist appears from below deck, coughing. Teo leaves the boat, followed
                immediately by his father, and Pipsqueak carrying The Duke on his
                shoulder.</description>

      <speech speaker="Mechanist">
         <charAction>Teo licking his fingers clean.</charAction> Yes, but unfortunately the

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">

   <section>
      <speech speaker="The Duke">And delicious. <charAction>They both lick the sauce that splashed all over their
                faces. Momo flies over to Pipsqueak and starts licking his face, much to his and The

            you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation! I mean I know you know that because
            otherwise why else would you be here? <charAction>Laughs nervously.</charAction> Uh
            anyway, <charAction>Dropping scrolls. Unraveling one on a board.</charAction> the Fire
            Lord's palace is here <charAction>Points at map, realizing it isn't the map, flips the
                chart several times until it is the map.</charAction>. Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh
            wait, it's here, <charAction>Brief shot of Due scratching his head.</charAction> and uh,
            there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't
            have any fire to use so that's good for us! <charAction>Brief shot of Teo and the
                mechanist looking on.</charAction> And ... um ... I'm sorry let me start at the
            beginning <charAction>Stands up straight, and begins talking very fast.</charAction>.
            Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but
            grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to
            live and then we met Suki, <charAction>Water Tribe warrior yawns.</charAction> who's a
            Kyoshi warrior. She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's
            friend was a crazy old king and ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Cut to Katara speaking over Sokka as he continues talking.</charAction>
            Wow, when he says the beginning he means the beginning beginning. <charAction>Hakoda
                gets up and approaches Sokka.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if
            you look at him in the front row you can see it ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Hakoda">
         <charAction>Interrupting.</charAction> Thank you, Sokka. It's okay why don't you
            take a break? <charAction>Sokka leaves the stage to sit down, disappointed in himself.
                Hakoda addresses the crowd.</charAction> Let me just clarify a few points for
            everyone. <charAction>Shot of Haru stroking his chin. Everyone pays attention to
                Hakoda.</charAction> Today, is the day of black sun, and I want to thank you all for
            your self-sacrifice, and your courage. There are two steps to the invasion, a naval
            stage, and then a land stage. <charAction>Shot of Sokka looking down, sad, Katara, Momo
                and Aang looking at Hakoda and Toph.</charAction> To gain sea access to the Fire
            Nation capital, we need to get past our first major obstacle here, <charAction>Points at
                map.</charAction> The Great Gates of Azulon. Next, we hit the land, and we hit hard.
            We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower. Once we do that, it's
            up to the Royal Palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="The Boulder">Excuse me. The Boulder is confused. Isn't the point to invade during the eclipse,
            when the firebenders are powerless?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Hakoda">The eclipse only lasts eight minutes, not enough time for the whole invasion. And
            the Royal Palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the
            eclipse's advantage the most. When this is finished, the Avatar will have defeated the
            Fire Lord. We will have control of the Fire Nation capital, and this war will be
            over!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The entire crowd cheers, and Sokka looks dismayed.</description>

                is bending four streams of water into water skins, Toph is putting on her Blind
                Bandit battle armor, Hakoda is putting on a black Water Tribe helmet, Appa is shown
                fully dressed in his armor which Sokka made, and Aang is shaving his head to show
                his Air Nomad tattoos. He is joined by a koala sheep. The scene cuts again to the
                Fire Nation Palace. Zuko takes off his head piece and armor, revealing the clothes
                underneath it and letting his hair hang down. He sits and starts to write a letter.
                The camera cuts once again to show Sokka, still dismayed, standing on the cliff side
                and Aang flying up to him.</description>

         <charAction>Approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.</charAction> Sokka, that

            good at that.</speech>

            should.</speech>

   <section>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Mechanist">Now don't sell yourself short, my boy. <charAction>Cut briefly to Katara and Huu
                waterbending.</charAction> It was your idea to use waterbending to make the subs
            sink and float, brilliant! <charAction>Cuts back to the mechanist opening a scroll,
                revealing a very crude drawing of a submarine.</charAction> Though your original

            fix. <charAction>Cut to outside of submarine as the submarines swim past, along with
                Aang on Appa.</charAction> The subs have a limited air supply. Before we land on the

                Cut to an overview of the Fire Nation port. An alarm goes off as the subs approach
                the gate. Several harpoons are launched at the subs, but most miss. One hits,
                causing a leak which is quickly sealed by a foggy swamp waterbender turning the
                water to ice, and pulls the attached sub out of the water. Katara quickly responds
                by piloting Appa out of the water and using waterbending to slice through the chain,
                dropping the sub back down.</description>

                instantly attacked by missiles. The subs open and several tanks exit while the other
                soldiers yell and charge out. The battle commences as they make their way inland,
                destroying battlements as they go. Earthbenders use rocks provided by a truck
                containing many rocks. Appa arrives and Katara jumps off as Fire Nation tanks
                appear. Teo is seen inside an earthbender tank before it destroys a battlement by
                crushing it. Another tank lifts its front up to slam down and crush a Fire Nation
                tank. More Fire Nation tanks arrive as the army pushes on. The swamp benders use
                water provided to destroy enemy tanks.</description>

                seaweed, is shown destroying more tanks. An earthbender tank is destroyed by a

      <description>Sokka, Hakoda, and Katara are shown riding a fully armored Appa. Sokka
                draws his sword and slices the end of a missile launcher off. As they fly past
                another, Hakoda throws two bombs inside the battlement. Cut to two soldiers running
                out as it explodes. Cut back to Appa as Katara breaks two barrels of water attached
                to either side of Appa as it forms around her arms. They fly past another battlement
                she freezes the soldier and launcher inside. Appa lands between two still
                operational battlements. The three jump off Appa.</description>

            backs. <charAction>Cut to Sokka and Katara, shown breaking into their battlement, Katara
                freezing the soldiers inside. Sokka uses his sword to cut through the launcher,
                causing part of it to fall out and explode outside as Katara and Sokka exit the
                battlement. They see Hakoda on the roof of his as he climbs inside. They hear noises
                from the ensuing fight until the launcher shoots and explodes, hearing Hakoda
                yelling out in pain. Cut to Sokka and Katara's worried faces as Hakoda exits,

        <speaker name="Iroh">Iroh</speaker>
        <speech>It's jook. I'm sure you wouldn't like it.</speech>

        <speech>Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. I'll do whatever it takes.

            <description>He looks and sees the main tent. Inside, Hakoda, Sokka's father, is looking
                at a map with more warriors, including Bato, now with scars on his arm. Bato nudges

            <description>The two embrace. Back at the Earth King's Royal Palace, the "Kyoshi

        <speech>Look Bosco! The Kyoshi Warriors are here to protect us! Aren't you excited?
                <charAction>Bosco yawns.</charAction> It's been a difficult week for me. My most
            trusted advisor, Long Feng, and his Dai Li agents tried to take control of Ba Sing Se
            from me.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Azula">Azula</speaker>
        <speech>It's terrible when you can't trust the people who are closest to you.</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Kuei">Kuei</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Pets Bosco.</charAction> But there is good news. As we speak, the
            Council of Five is meeting to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation this summer, on the
            day of a solar eclipse.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>For a second, Azula's eyes slightly widen with shock and worry upon hearing
                this, but she quickly hides it.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Azula">Azula</speaker>
        <speech>Really? Now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan. <charAction>Glances
                off as Mai and Ty Lee look at each other.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="General How">General How</speaker>
        <speech>General Fong's base will serve as the launching point for the attack. In exactly two
            months, the army and navy will invade the Fire Nation on the Day of Black Sun.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Momo jumps on the map and begins knocking over the pieces.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Katara">Katara</speaker>
        <speech>Or we could send in Momo to do some damage! <charAction>Chuckles. The Council of
                Five are unamused.</charAction> 'Cause, the ... sorry.</speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="General How">General How</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Uses earthbending to stand the pieces back up, scaring
                Momo.</charAction> All we need is the Earth King's seal in order to execute the
            plan. <charAction>Sends the scroll across the table to Katara.</charAction></speech>

            <description>Aang continues his journey to the Eastern Air Temple. He spots Guru Pathik,
                who is meditating, and lands Appa.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>Uhhh ... hello? You're Guru Pathik, right? <charAction>Aang approaches
                Pathik.</charAction> The person who attached the note to Appa's horn?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>Indeed. I was a spiritual brother of your people and a personal friend of Monk
            Gyatso. <charAction>Aang looks slightly surprised to hear this.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>In your note, <charAction>Aang sits.</charAction> you said you could teach me how to
            gain control of the Avatar State. How?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>You must gain balance within yourself, before you can bring balance to the world.
            And the first step to gaining balance begins with this. <charAction>Hands Aang a yellow
                beverage in a wooden cup.</charAction> Drink up!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Takes it and looks at it. Drinks it and quickly spits it out to his left
                in disgust.</charAction> Uggh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>That's because it is! <charAction>Pathik empties another bowl and holds it over his
                head.</charAction> Yum yum!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Aang blinks in disbelief. Meanwhile, Xin Fu and Master Yu are working to
                bring Toph back to the Beifong Estate.</description>
        </speech>

    <p>
        <speaker name="Yu">Yu</speaker>

        <speech>What are you talking about? The Beifong Estate's this way!</speech>

        <speaker name="Yu">Yu</speaker>
        <speech>I'm quite certain you're mistaken.</speech>

        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Banging at the cell.</charAction> Hey! Can you two old ladies quit your
            bickering for a second? <charAction>Cut to inside the cell.</charAction> I got to go to
            the bathroom!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Yu">Yu</speaker>
        <speech>Oooh ... uhhh, okay, but make it quick! <charAction>Getting up with a key in

        <speaker name="Xin Fu">Xin Fu</speaker>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Yu">Yu</speaker>
        <speech>Ooh, very sneaky Toph! Nice try, but you can't trick me! <charAction>Sits
                down.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Toph">Toph</speaker>
        <speech>Let me out of here so I can kick both your butts!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Xin Fu">Xin Fu</speaker>
        <speech>Quit your banging! <charAction>Bangs the metal box.</charAction> You might think
            you're the greatest earthbender in the world, but even you can't bend metal!</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Toph looks sad as she places her hand on a side of the metal box. The scene
                cuts to that night, and where Azula, Mai and Ty Lee are staying which is a small
                building in the Upper Ring. Mai and Ty Lee are removing their make-up. A smiling Ty
                Lee is looking in a mirror. She is wiping the last traces of her Kyoshi makeup from
                her face. Mai is seated next to Ty Lee, still working on her own face.</description>

        <speech>Mai finally gets to wear make-up that's not totally depressing? <charAction>Azula

        <speaker name="Mai">Mai</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>With large, dark splotches of black makeup dripping down her eyes;

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Azula">Azula</speaker>
        <speech>I'm talking about conquering the whole Earth Kingdom. <charAction>The two girls turn
                with shocked looks.</charAction> For one hundred years, the Fire Nation has hammered
            away at Ba Sing Se from the outside. <charAction>Walks away from the girls and smirks
                while looking out of a window.</charAction> But now we're on the inside, and we can
            take it by ourselves.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Ty Lee">Ty Lee</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Admiringly.</charAction> Gosh, you're so confident. I really admire that
            about you.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Azula">Azula</speaker>
        <speech>From the inside, we're in perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the
            Earth King. The key is the Dai Li. Whoever controls the Dai Li <charAction>Turns back
                into the room.</charAction> controls Ba Sing Se.</speech>

            <description>Back to the Eastern Air Temple at a creek.</description>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Aang, tell me
            everything you know about chakras.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Rubs eyes.</charAction> What are chakras?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Disappointedly.</charAction> Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the
            basics. <charAction>As he explains he points to the water and the moss
                within.</charAction> The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows
            through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around
            before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>Exactly. If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However,
            life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek. And then what happens?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>The creek can't flow?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>Yes. But, if we open the ponds between the pools ... <charAction>He removes moss
                blocking the exit for the water.</charAction></speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech>The energy flows! <charAction>The water that was blocked by the moss becomes clear.
                Aang and Pathik smile at each other.</charAction></speech>

            <description>In another part of the temple, a cavern.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and
            can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck. Be warned, opening the chakras is
            an intense experience, and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven
            are open. Are you ready?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Momentarily looks down.</charAction> I'll do whatever it takes.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with
            survival, and is blocked by fear. What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become
            clear to you.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>Aang sees images of things that cause him great fear, including the Blue
                Spirit attacking him, General Fong sinking Katara into the ground, himself merging
                with La at the North Pole, Fire Lord Ozai, and Sozin's Comet, which make him
                scream.</description>
        </speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival, but you must
            surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek. <charAction>Aang clears the
                image away.</charAction> You have opened your Earth Chakra! <charAction>Aang wipes
                sweat off his forehead.</charAction></speech>

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a guru too! This chakra deals with pleasure and
            is blocked by guilt. Now, look at all the guilt with burdens you so. What do you blame
            yourself for?</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Aang">Aang</speaker>
        <speech><charAction>Sees the image of him leaving home.</charAction> I ran away.
                <charAction>Sees images of him in the Avatar State at General Fong's
                base.</charAction> I hurt all of those people.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker name="Pathik">Pathik</speaker>
        <speech>Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison
            your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive
            yourself. <charAction>Aang takes a deep, focused breath, opening his Water
                Chakra.</charAction></speech>

        <speech>Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed. When a ship
            detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller and the foul smell forces
            people to abandon the ship. I call it the "stink and sink."</speech>

        <speech><charAction>Chuckles.</charAction> Good one! Moving on. This chakra deals with
            willpower, and is blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of? <charAction>Cuts to Aang's
                vision of his first attempt at firebending, which resulted in him accidentally
                burning Katara's hands.</charAction> What are your biggest disappointments in

        <speech>You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar
            and therefore, you are a firebender. <charAction>Aang breathes deeply.</charAction> Hmmm
            ... that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a ... burping

            <description>Back at the palace, two Dai Li agents hide on two pillars and secretly spy
                on a conversation between Mai and Ty Lee. The former is sitting on the stairs and
                the latter is practicing chi blocking and acrobatics.</description>

        <speech>The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love and is blocked by
            grief. <charAction>Aang smiles and looks at a Air Nomad statue nearby before looking
                sad.</charAction> Lay all your grief out in front of you.</speech>

            <description>Aang sees images of many airbenders, including Gyatso and Yangchen. He

        <speech>You have indeed felt a great loss. <charAction>The airbenders appear floating in the

                <charAction>Aang is lifted into the air and sees the Air Nomads floating in the
                smoke.</charAction> The Air Nomads' love for you has not left this world. It is
            still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love.</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>
            <description>The smoke in front of Aang forms a face and shows the first thing he saw
                upon waking up from his iceberg: Katara. Back in the real world, Aang is starting to
                cry tears of joy.</description>

                <charAction>Aang inhales and, seeing an image of himself on a cliff looking down at
                the ground, exhales, and accepts his nature.</charAction> Very good, Aang. You have

        <speech>The sixth pool of energy is the light chakra, located in the center of the forehead.
            It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is
            the illusion of separation. Things you think are separate and different are actually one
            in the same.</speech>

        <speech>That's right! Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion. If you open
            your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole.
            Even metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined.</speech>

            <description>As Pathik speaks, the camera fades to Xin Fu and Yu trying to take Toph

        <speech>Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able to go in and out of the Avatar

            <description>Aang sees an image of him letting Katara go, and a bridge that will lead
                him to Avatar State mastery. His image looks down, smiles at the bridge, and walks
                up to the Avatar Spirit, which is an enlarged image of himself in the Avatar State.
                The Avatar Spirit is holding a ball of energy, and Aang walks directly inside of it.
                As he does so, his tatooes glow, and he closes his eyes. Right before he is able to
                completely open the final chakra and master the Avatar State, however, he hears a
                shriek from Katara and sees a vision of her in chains. At this, he jumps out of the
                energy sphere and runs away from the Avatar Spirit. The energy bridge that lead him
                there slowly vanishes behind him until it catches up and falls from underneath him,
                causing his image to plummet toward Earth. This cuts his connection to the Avatar
                State, which forces him back to reality.</description>

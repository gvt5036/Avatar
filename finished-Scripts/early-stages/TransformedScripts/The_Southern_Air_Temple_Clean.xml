      <description>The episode begins with a beautiful sunrise that just peeks above some
                cliffs. The beams of the morning sun reflect on the water, bathing the whole scene
                in yellow light. The camera pans to the left, where the group has made camp on the
                shore. Appa is seen chewing on some grass while the smoke of the nearby campfire
                rises to the sky. Sokka is lying in a blue sleeping bag next to the fire. The camera
                zooms in on Aang and Katara atop Appa. Aang sits on the bison's head and is checking
                the knots that tie the reins to Appa's horns. Katara is sitting on the saddle,
                fiddling with their luggage.</description>

      <description>Aang jumps off Appa, landing softly due to his airbending. A side-view
                shows him as he walks over to a snoring Sokka, who is lying in his sleeping bag. The
                shot changes to a view from next to Sokka's head, looking up at the approaching
                airbender.</description>

      <description>Sokka turns around, showing his back to Aang and falls back asleep, snoring
                as soon as his eyes close. Close-up of Aang, whose big eyes blink in surprise. He
                looks discontent with Sokka's attitude, but he quickly smiles mischievously. Aang
                grabs a small, thin stick.</description>

         <charAction>Alarmed.</charAction> Sokka! Wake up! <charAction>Aang moves the stick

                bag.</charAction> Get it off! Get it off! <charAction>After two hops, Sokka slams
                flat to the ground.</charAction> Ahh!</speech>

      <description>The scene slowly fades to a harbor, where several Fire Nation ships are
                lined up next to each other. The camera pans to the left to reveal a smaller ship
                docked between all the others, identical mastodons. Its walkway is down and the
                small figures of two persons are seen leaving the ship. Cut to a closer shot of Zuko
                and Iroh, as they reach the bottom of the walkway.</description>

                arm movements.</charAction> Once word gets out that he's alive, every firebender

      <speech speaker="Zhao">
         <charAction>Iroh and Zuko turn, with shocked expressions on their face, toward the

   <section>
      <description>The man walks over to the duo with his hands held behind his back. Zuko

      <description>Zhao smiles evilly at him as he starts to walk away, but after a few steps,
                Iroh place his hand on his shoulder to hold him back.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect. <charAction>Removes his hand from
                Zuko's shoulder as he faces Zhao while Zuko just slants his eyes.</charAction> We
            would be honored to join you. Do you have any ginseng tea? It's my favorite.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Iroh and Zhao walk off screen. Zuko grunts in anger upon hearing Iroh's tea
                comment. He growls angrily and firebends a small arc out of annoyance as he turns to
                walk after them.</description>
      <description>The scene cuts to Appa, who is flying above the clouds in the Patola
                Mountain range. A closer shot reveals Aang and Katara sitting atop Appa's head, and
                Sokka is back in the saddle. Switch to a close-up of him clutching his stomach at it
                growls. Close-up of his face, with a look of dismay all over it.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka starts to go through the luggage and gets out a bag. He looks at it
                for a moment while it sways in the wind. With his tongue out of his mouth full
                anticipation, he sticks his hand in the bag and starts to go through it. He looks
                surprised for a moment, but quickly and with anticipation turns the bag upside down
                to pour the contents into his hand. Close-up of his gloved hand as only a few crumbs
                of blubbered seal jerky fall into it.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">

      <speech speaker="Sokka">

            They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Ponders over her words for a bit. Hopefully.</charAction> Just because
            no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. They

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Cheerfully, as Katara moves her hand back to her side.</charAction> You
            don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying
            bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison! <charAction>Caresses Appa's
                head.</charAction> Right, Appa?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa grunts. The camera moves back to show that Appa flies past to begin a
                last ascent up the side of a mountain.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Yip yip!</speech>

   <section>
      <description>An overview shot follows Appa's flight up the mountain and through the
                clouds. Appa turns out of sight behind the flank of a mountain. The camera view
                shifts and Appa is seen emerging from behind that flank and turns further upward.
                Close-up of his passengers. Aang holds onto the reins tightly as Appa rapidly
                ascends while Katara, whose eyes are closed, and Sokka hold on tight to Appa's fur
                and saddle respectively. Aang looks back for a moment to his passengers. The camera
                switches to a further off view of Appa as he flies over the rocks and into the sky
                again. He flies over a last ridge that is covered with trees. The camera pans up to
                reveal a large temple as Appa floats toward it.</description>

      <description>The scene switches back to the Earth Kingdom docks, where several Fire Navy
                ships are lined up. Something that looks like a railroad stretches out along the
                shipyard. The camera moves to the right to reveal a number of tents lined up in
                front of the ships. One of the bigger tents is being guarded by two Fire Nation
                soldiers. Switch to a shot of Zhao inside the tent, standing in front of a large map
                of the Avatar World that is hung up on the wall. He holds his hands behind his back.
                The camera slowly starts to move back.</description>

                and Iroh, standing in the corner, looking at some weapons that are placed against

      <description>Iroh knocks over a weapon display behind them. The weapons come crashing
                down with a lot of noise. The general cowers at the noise and the damage he wrecked.
                Zhao turns around looking annoyed.</description>

      <description>As Zuko approaches the door, the guards stop him from leaving by crossing
                their spears while a third soldier enters the room. The camera switches to Zhao's
                point of view. Zuko and the two soldiers blocking his path can be seen in the
                background. The camera pans to the right to reveal the soldier that entered walking
                up to Zhao.</description>

      <description>The scene fades to a shot of the Southern Air Temple, as the camera slowly
                moves closer toward it. Cut to Appa, who has landed at the base of snow covered
                stairs. The camera quickly pans up to reveal three small figures making their way up
                the mountain trail. The lead figure is running. Close-up of Aang as he runs at the
                front, excitedly looking back at the two siblings. As the two emerge from behind a

   <section>
      <description>Katara smiles at her brother and Aang's face clears up. He smiles too, as
                he looks at Sokka from the corners of his eyes. Cut to a shot of Sokka, looking
                concentrated while standing on a pole and guarding the goal of the airball court.
                The camera quickly moves back to the other side of the court, where Aang also stands
                on one of the tall poles, suspending a hollow ball in the air with airbending. He
                lets the ball roll over his shoulders, tosses it from side to side and lazily tosses
                it up in the air. He looks and smiles innocently at Sokka with his hands behind his
                back. Switch to Sokka, who looks surprised at the upward movement of the ball before
                cutting back to Aang who opens one eye as the ball comes down again. The airbender
                jumps up and kicks the ball away with a powerful air swipe. It rapidly shoots across
                the poles, changing direction as it crashes into several poles, but steadily moving
                closer toward Sokka's goal. Switch to Sokka's point of view as the ball races
                quickly toward him. Change to a side-view of Sokka, who opens his mouth in shock. He
                grunts as the ball hits him right in the stomach. The force of impact sends Sokka
                and the ball flying backward, right through the rotating door of the goal behind
                him. The camera moves further back to reveal Sokka crashing into the snow behind the
                goal. Aang laughs as he jumps up in joy. Close-up of Aang as he holds a hand above
                his eyes to make out where Sokka landed.</description>

                when he sees something in front of him and he crawls to the front. The camera shifts
                to reveal an old Fire Nation helmet lying in the snow. It has been battered by the
                elements, and shows signs of cracks and burns. He looks up at his

                one of insecurity. She glances at the helmet and back at the approaching Aang.
                Suddenly she shifts her weight and brings her arms up. With one swift movement she
                swings her arms back, manipulating the overhanging snow to fall down, obscuring the
                helmet and Sokka from sight.</description>

                the trio has made it to a courtyard with a fountain in the middle. The water is
                frozen. Sokka and Katara are standing at the entrance of the courtyard, while Aang

                statue's face, the scene changes to a flashback of Aang's past, the statue's face is
                replaced by the face of the real Gyatso. The scenery also become much brighter as it
                is a flashback of a sunny day at the Southern Air Temple.</description>

      <description>They shift their weight to the front, launching their air balls. The balls
                send the four fruit pies flying high in the air, disappearing in the clouds. The
                scene of the flying cakes switches to a shot of four monks in lotus, meditating
                quietly between some trees. Suddenly, the cakes drop out of the sky and each of the
                monks is hit on the head by one of the colorful desserts. The monk at the far left
                of the line topples over upon impact. The moment the pies hit their heads, several
                flying lemurs appear and start to stuff their faces. One of the lemurs jumps up and
                down on the stomach of the toppled-over monk, while another grabs some cake right of
                the head of the monk on the far right. One of the lemurs jumps on the head on one of
                the monks. Cut back to Aang and Gyatso, who are laughing loudly at the scene. Aang
                is clutching his stomach, while Monk Gyatso is leaning on the railing of the
                balcony. They both move back from the railing when they are done laughing. The two

                shot of inside the corridor. The round symbol of intertwined air currents, the
                national symbol of the Air Nomads is largely embedded in the floor, surrounded by
                two square shapes that form some sort of sun together. The camera pans up to reveal
                that the trio has reached the entrance of the air temple sanctuary. The door
                supports a combination of metal colored pipes and three, blue, rolled up, pipes that
                are similar looking and arranges like the symbol for airbending. The large wooden
                door is framed by the branches of an old tree standing on the left of it and the
                hallway is illuminated by sunlight that falls through little, round

                his back to it, trying to push the giant door open. When the door does not move, he
                sighs, slides down to the floor, disappointed, and rests against the

      <description>Close-up of Aang, as he takes a deep breath. He spreads his arms and
                thrusts them forward, sending an air current into both of the tubes on the door. The
                camera follows the path of the right air current as it travels through the pipe. The
                wind makes one of the blue curled tube turn around. When it does, the tube changes
                colors to purple and the wind blows out like a horn. The process is repeated for the
                other two blue tubes as well. When the three blue tubes have turned and become
                purple, the camera moves back to show that Aang has unlocked the door and it slowly
                starts to open. Switch to a shot from inside the sanctuary, as the door cracks open
                and light penetrates the dark room. The doors sway open and Aang is seen standing
                there with Katara and Sokka in the background. The scene switches to a shot from

                The only light comes from the open door behind them and illuminates the scene with

                comes in through the door. A long-eared shadow of another being that is approaching
                moves over it. The camera pans to the right toward the statues, but the trio cannot
                be seen. Overview shot from among the statues where Katara and Aang are hiding

                appears from behind the statue, his club to the ready, but lowers it as soon as he
                sees the animal. Aang and Katara peek form behind their statue as well. Frontal view

      <description>Sokka stretches his hand while he excitedly lunges himself at the animal
                from behind the statue. Aang runs up at the lemur as well. Point of view switches to
                that of the boys. The lemur arcs his back in fright, his ears, hair and tail
                standing upright as the snatching hands of the boys draw closer. Switch to a back
                view of the lemur. It startles, quickly turns around and makes a break for it. Sokka
                barely misses the animal and falls down. Aang nimbly avoids tripping as well by
                using Sokka's head as a stepping stone. Switch to an overview shot as Sokka quickly
                gets up and runs behind Aang and the lemur as they exit the sanctuary.</description>

      <description>Aang and Sokka come sliding around the corner and give chase. Sokka passes
                Aang and shoves him back. Cut to a side-view of Sokka running in the lead. Aang
                pulls up next to him again, so Sokka takes out his club and takes a swing at Aang's
                legs. Aang nimbly avoids the club and uses his airbending to run on the side of the
                wall, laughing loudly with amusement. Cut to a shot from Sokka's point of view as
                Aang runs up ahead. The airbender runs on the floor again. He quickly turns around
                and directs on airball at Sokka, which knocks his legs from underneath him. Sokka
                flips in the air before smacking face first on the ground, his hood falling over his
                head while he lands. Switch to a frontal view from a balcony as the lemur exits the
                corridor and sits on the ledge of the balcony, looking back at the approaching Aang.
                He pricks his ears again and takes flight with a scared look on his face. Cut to a
                shot from over Aang's shoulder as he is running down the hall. He briefly glances
                over to see if Sokka is still following. He too exits the hallway and without
                slowing down, he jumps over the ledge of the balcony, behind the lemur. Cut to a
                shot from underneath Aang. The airbender turns in the air and uses some of the rocks
                to break his freefall, jumping from one rock to the other. Cut back to Sokka, who
                too has reached the balcony, but stops there while looking over the
                rim.</description>

      <description>The view changes to one from beside the skeleton; its fingers are clearly
                visible in the front as Aang drops to his knees in the background and lets out a
                mournful sigh. Cut to Sokka, who pulls the drapes aside and looks
                around.</description>

                to a side-view of Aang sitting on his knees, his head cupped in his hands. Sokka
                walks toward him. Reassuring.</charAction> Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the
            lemur, okay? <charAction>He approaches Aang with a smile on his face, but shakes his
                head and does a double take.</charAction> Oh, man. <charAction>Switch to a shot of

            get out of here.</speech>

      <description>Suddenly, Aang's arrow tattoos begin to glow a bluish white. Cut to a
                frontal view of Aang, as he lifts his head, his eyes glowing in the same color. The
                camera pans up; Sokka retracts his hands and gasps for air in fright. Switch to an
                overview shot of inside the sanctuary where Katara is walking down the circular
                pattern of statues. She stops before and looks at the statue of Avatar Roku. Cut to
                a close-up of the statue's face. The camera's point of view switches to behind
                Roku's shoulder. Katara suddenly looks surprised as a bluish, white light
                illuminates her face; it seems to come from the statue. Cut back to a close-up of
                the statue. Its eyes are gleaming bright. The bright light spreads to the other
                statues and one by one, their eyes start to gleam. The camera pans up to reveal how
                the light travels from statue to statue and makes its way up to the top of the
                sanctuary. The camera's point of view switches again to behind Roku's shoulder to

      <description>Switch to another temple hidden somewhere in the mountains. Inside the
                temple is a man, dressed in the typical green of the Earth Kingdom, sitting in front
                of a painting of past earth Avatars. Their eyes also begin to gleam brightly. Cut to
                a frontal view of the man's frightened expression. The light is so strong that it
                casts long shadows on his face. Switch to somewhere on one of the poles, where two
                Water Tribe civilians are looking at the water temple's roof that glows bright with
                bluish, white light. Cut to a far-off view of the Fire Temple; its roof glows with a
                reddish light. Cut to a view from inside the temple, where a Fire Sage is leaning

                shot of Aang's feet, where a whirlwind begins to form. The wind kicks away a bone.
                The camera slowly pans up. The wind kicks up and forms a sphere around Aang; his
                eyes and tattoos still glowing brightly. Aang's clothes flutter heavily in the
                wind.</description>

                against the wall. The air sphere has expanded to a raging tornado with Aang in its
                center. Sokka peeks at Aang from behind a rock. Switch to an overview shot as Katara

                from over her shoulder. The sphere of wind that engulfs slowly starts to rise in the
                air. Katara is pushed back by the strong wind currents that fill the remains of the
                building as the sphere ascends higher and higher.</description>

                duo has readied themselves for battle, so he rings a large gong. Cut back to a
                side-view of Zuko and Zhao standing in the middle of the arena, both taking on a
                firebending stance. Close-up of Zuko, who has his hands stretched out in front of
                him, glaring at Zhao. Switch to Zhao, who stands the same as Zuko. The screen
                splits; the upper pane is a close-up of Zhao's eyes and slowly slides to the left,
                the lower is a close-up of Zuko's eyes and slowly slides to the right.</description>
      <description>Cut to a view from behind Zuko, as he starts to lower his arms, leaving a
                trail of fire behind. Camera moves to a frontal view of Zuko, as he directs a strong
                fire blast at Zhao. Zhao moves to the left, out of the way of the blast before
                moving back to the right to avoid another blast. Switch to a shot of Zhao's left
                foot with Zuko in the background; the camera pans to the right. The prince shoots
                two more strong blast at Zhao. Frontal view of Zhao, as he crosses his arms in front
                of him and takes the blasts head on. He moves one arm up and the other down,
                dissipating the flames. He smirks at Zuko, who is seen panting heavily with his arm
                still stretched out from his last attack. He angrily grinds his teeth and performs a
                roundhouse kick, spraying flames toward the camera. The shot switches to a side-view
                of Zhao, who creates his own flames to push away Zuko's blazing attack. He performs
                his trick again. Close-up of Zuko, who squints his eyes and directs another powerful
                flame kick in Zhao's direction. Close-up of a smirking Zhao, who holds his own fire
                ready. He launches forward. Shot of his feet, showing his strong stance as he swings
                his arms over the ground, severing Zuko's next attack. The camera switches from
                Zhao, who seems unfazed by Zuko's attacks to Zuko, who is panting heavily with
                fatigue. Cut to Iroh, who is holding his fist up while rooting for his
                nephew.</description>

      <description>Side-view of Zhao, who ferociously attacks Zuko with a strong fire blast.
                Zuko is thrown back a bit by the force of the attack while he diverts the flames to
                both of his sides. Zhao takes a step forward. Closer shot as he directs another
                powerful blast at the prince, using both his arms this time. Zuko is thrown back
                again, but still diverts the fire away from him. Zhao takes another step forward and
                fires again with the same result on Zuko's side. Shot of Zhao, who firmly plants his
                foot down; cut to a shot where he holds his both wrists together and fires another
                strong blast. Zuko is thrown back upon impact and slides back several meters over
                the ground. He lifts his head while grunting in pain. His expression turns to one of
                shock as he looks up and sees that Zhao has jumped up and is soaring through the
                skies toward him. With a loud scream, he lands at Zuko's feet, erects himself and
                thrusts his fist forward to deliver the final blow.</description>
      <description>Cut to Zuko's eyes, which open wide in fright as the fire reflects in them.
                At the last possible second, a frontal shot of Zuko shows him rolling out of the way
                and swirling his feet around. The view switches to a side-view of Zuko as he, while
                getting up in this swirl, swipes Zhao's legs from underneath him. This same move is
                shown two more times, from a closer side-view and from a close-up angled shot of
                Zuko's perspective, before cutting to a shot of Zuko's feet as he firmly plants them
                on the ground. Close-up as he smiles confidently. Switch to a shot from over the
                ground as Zuko steps forward, sliding fire at Zhao's feet, who steps back. Zhao is
                caught off balance and wobbles backward. Zuko keeps repeating his move, directing
                his attacks at Zhao's feet in an attempt to throw him off balance. Switch to Zhao,
                who falls back in distress and subsequently to Iroh, who smiles approvingly. Cut to
                Zuko, who directs a powerful kick at his adversary. Zhao barely pushes it out of the
                way while staggering back ever further. Zuko kicks again and this time he succeeds
                in knocking the commander over. Zhao falls down and rolls over the ground, where he
                ends up on his back. Zuko runs up at him and threatens him with an outstretched arm,
                ready to deliver the final blow. Zhao brings his head up and looks at Zuko. Close-up
                of Zuko's eyes and back to a shot of Zhao's face.</description>

                facing Zuko. He suddenly turns around and aims a powerful kick at Zuko, spreading
                his flames. Before Zuko notices anything, however, Iroh intervenes and grabs Zhao's
                foot, dissipating the fire. Iroh tosses Zhao back who slides away on his back. Zuko
                wants to charge Zhao in anger, but Iroh stops him.</description>

      <description>Sokka is about to take another bite of the peach he is eating. Cut to a
                shot of Aang, who looks surprised when the lemur suddenly leaps off his arm and
                returns, holding the peach. The animal starts to nibble from it.</description>

      <description>Cut to a wider shot. Sokka still stands there, mouth open and hand in front
                of his mouth, ready to take a bite, however, he has no peach anymore. The others
                start to laugh upon seeing Sokka's expression. Cut to a panoramic view of the
                Southern Air Temple at dusk; the camera slowly pans to the right. Cut to Aang, who
                is sadly staring back at it, leaning on the luggage that is tied at the back on
                Appa's saddle. Momo chitters quietly as they fly further away from the temple. Dark
                clouds slowly move in front of the temple, obscuring their view.</description>

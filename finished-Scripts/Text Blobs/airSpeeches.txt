Appa! Appa!  Appa! No. No!  I guess this means we'll always be together.  Always.  My staff! Yip yip!  Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.  Avatar Day? There's a holiday for the Avatar. Who knew? Having a huge festival in your honor is great, but frankly, it's just nice to be appreciated. That's the biggest me I've ever seen!  That party pooper's my friend!  No, I'm not, I ...  It's true! I'm on your side.  You think that I ... murdered someone?  Huh! Give me a chance to clear my name!  I'll gladly stand trial! No problem.  How was I supposed to know they wouldn't take Water Tribe money? I can't.  I can't do that with people thinking I'm a murderer either. I need you guys to help prove my innocence.  That's okay, Sokka. For some reason, I thought you were an expert detective. So, you'll help me with my case?  You think so?  I don't know ...  You guys are great. Then how can I prove my innocence?  Right ... evidence. Ladies and gentlemen ... I'm about to tell you what really happened. And I will prove it with facts. Fact number one. Uhhh ... Oh, yeah. You see ... I have very large feet. Furthermore ... your temple matches your statue. But ... I was in a painting at sunset. So, there you have it, I'm not guilty.  Hey, everybody! Avatar Kyoshi here.   So, what just happened? I said I would face justice, so I will.  Gee, I'd love to help, but I'm supposed to be boiled in oil. Hey, look! A sword made out of a whale's tooth.  No, we found something!  So, then what happened?  Who the what now?  Hi, I'm Aang. Thank you, it's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything-   Yeah, nothing's cozier than dead animal skins.  Hey, I ride animals, too! There was this one time when I rode a giant eel and I-  What's that story? I can't believe they would leave me. Uhhh, I know Bato! It's the map to Sokka and Katara's dad! Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long. Yup, but now I'm back. Sure could go for some delicious sea prunes!  I'm sorry, I'll take care of this.  What's ice dodging?  I know that. Why wouldn't I know that? I'm the Avatar; I know about trust.  What does that even mean? I can't.   No, you can't trust me.  A messenger gave this to me for Bato. You have to understand. I was afraid you would- Okay. You too. Guess I should be moving on. I'm an idiot, Momo.  Looks like we're going alone, guys.  Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone. Who? Zuko. A necklace? Katara! You've got something I want. So ... where do we go?  Don't you want to see your father? I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you ... Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like ... this?  Zuko asked me to be sure I got it to you. Sure. Today's the day! Can you believe it? After all that time searching for a teacher, I'm finally starting earthbending! And this place, it's perfect, don't you think? Sokka? Oh, you're still sleeping, huh? Sorry. Good morning, Sifu Toph.  Well, if you think I should ...  So what move are you going to teach me first? Rock-a-lanche? The Trembler? Oh, maybe I could learn to make a whirlpool out of land!  Sounds good, sounds good! Like a rock. Got it. I'm ready.  Maybe there's another way ... what if I came at the boulder from another angle? Whoa!  Yeah, thanks, Katara! I guess I just panicked. I don't know what to say.  I know. I'm sorry. No, I don't think I do. Yeah, that sounds good. I don't want to talk about it.  I know, I know, I know, I know! I get it, all right? I need to face it head on like a rock, but I just can't do it. I don't know why I can't, but I can't. I guess it's earth. Thanks, Katara. Sifu Katara.  As a matter of fact, I don't mind. I'm happy to share anything I have. Actually, I prefer if you didn't ... That's an antique, handcrafted by the monks ... It's a delicate instrument!  Ohm.  Meditating here! We'll find him faster if we split up.  Sokka! Are you okay?  Hmmm ... I bet I can airbend you out of here.  I can't ... I can't do it. I can't do that either. It would just be really ... uncomfortable. Thanks, Sokka. This whole earthbending thing really has me confused. There's so much pressure. Everyone expects me to get it right away. It puts me in a really awkward position. If I try, I fail. If I don't try, I'm never going to get it. I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. Awww, what a cute name for a baby saber-tooth moose-lion cub. It's hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in. What are you doing out here little guy? Did you lose your mama? Hey there, we found your cub! See, we have no problem with you! We're friendly! Oh no! Woo-hoo, look at me! I won't. What? You were there the whole time? Why didn't you do something? Sokka was in trouble! I was in trouble! You could have gotten him out and helped us get away!  Enough! I want my staff back!  What? But– I can't believe it! No problem, Sokka!  Hey Katara, look what I can do!  Appa, Appa, I can earthbend now! The key is being completely rooted. Physically and mentally unmovable!  It's such a big city. I'm comin' for ya, buddy. He's here; I can feel it.  This is why I never came here before. I always heard it was so different from the way the monks taught us to live.   Can we see the king now?  If we're going to be here for a month, we should spend our time looking for Appa.   If someone wanted to sell a stolen animal without anyone knowing, where would they go‌?  Nice to meet you, Pong. You mean, platypus bear?  Gopher bear? Yeah, I'm mastering every element. How hard could manners be‌? Good evening, Mr. Sokka Water Tribe, Ms. Katara Water Tribe, Lord Momo of the Momo Dynasty. Your Momo-ness.   Earth!  Wow, you look beautiful.  Where are they? Or we could go in as these guys. Toph said we might pass as busboys!  Where are Toph and Katara?  I don't know what he looks like. That could be anyone!  You found us! Sorry. No, don't shout.  Watch this, everybody! Greetings, Your Majesty. This could be the most important thing he's ever heard.  I'll tell them! I'll make sure everyone knows!  Great, you're back! What's for dinner? It's coming from over there! Let's go meet him!  Nice to meet you! Hey! That guy's gotta be running somewhere. Maybe we're near a village? And I bet that village has a market! Great hat! I'll trade you some nuts for it.  No, she doesn't. We saw you earthbending. Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay. You must have really inspired him.  What?  And ... why would they do that?  Sure, sure. I got it.  Yeah, yeah. Just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this.  Exactly! That's fun stuff!  Katara, what's wrong? Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka?  Go hide. I wish I knew how to make a hurricane! The warden would run away and we'd steal his keys! I'm just tossing ideas around. No, it's not. Look at the smoke! I bet they're burning coal. In other words, earth.>  Guys! Throw me some coal! Where's Momo?  Hang on, Momo! All right, you too.   That works.  What? Why wouldn't we fly?  Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow.  He's right.  Who knows? Walking might be fun. Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?  I'm tired of carrying this pack. That's a great idea. Hey, Sokka's instincts, would you mind- Sokka, your shirt!  Nice work, Sokka! How'd you do that?  You just took out a whole army almost single-handed.  Ha, ha, Pipsqueak, that's a funny name.   It's hilarious! You guys have a hideout? I'll get up on my own.   Nice place you got! Thanks Jet. Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me! Ow! Quit it! What? He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life, a really fun way of life. What can we do? Sorry, Sokka. Really? Sokka apologized?  What about me? Look, there's another steam vent.   I bet that's enough, and I'm not just saying that to be lazy.  I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout. Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation. Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam. I've gotta stop him.  I need to get to the dam. I'm not gonna fight you, Jet.  Sokka's still out there, he's our only chance. Sokka didn't make it in time. We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead? Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head.  Come on, let's get busy!  I just finished dropping all the leaflets. Has anyone come in with news about Appa? Wow, you're right! Patience really pays off! Joo Dee? Why are you here?  We don't care about the rules and we're not asking permission! We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our way!   I don't care! From now on, we do whatever it takes to find Appa!  Katara, we have to give him a chance. Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to check it out. There's nothing here.  We missed him.   What island? Where's Appa? We've got to get to Whaletail Island! Where's Whaletail Island?  I don't care. We have a chance to find Appa! We have to try! Don't worry, on the way back we'll be flying! I bet they have Appa here in the city. Maybe he's in the same place they took Jet! Where did they take you? We need to find a way to jog his real memories.  A bad one.  Long Feng is escaping! You do have Appa! Tell me where he is!  You're definitely not! Jet, it's me, Aang! You don't have to do this! Jet, I'm your friend! Look inside your heart! He can't make you do this! You're a Freedom Fighter!  Don't be. Appa's gone! Long Feng beat us here. I don't think it's gonna matter! What is it, Momo? Appa!  I missed you, buddy.  Wait! Four days? The invasion's in four days?  I guess.  Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord! I'm bringing you down. Oh no! It was just a dream, Momo. I still have my pants. Well, I better keep training. A couple hours. I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm gonna fight Ozai. You don't get it, do you? My form is bad, I'm sloppy, and I still don't know any firebending. Not even the basics. Okay, well I still have to work on everything else. I better spend the whole day training.  Good night, Katara. Good night, Sokka. Good night, Toph. Good night, Appa. Good night, Momo. Good night, Appa and Mo-  Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down! And this time, I brought pants. Math test? Oh no! I forgot all about the math test! I've gotta be ready. But I forgot my pants and my math test. Sokka, get up! I needa know what day it is! Sokka, you've gotta get up drill your rock-climbing exercises. In one of my dreams, you were running from Fire Nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, but you were too slow and they got you!  Then climb that cliff! Climb it fast!  Don't drink that! In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom! We died because of your tiny bladder. And you need to start wearing your hair up. In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and-.  You're right. I'm losing my mind. It's like every time I think about how stressed I am, I just end up more stressed. I'm like a big growing snowball of nerves.  I feel ... really warm. Like there's this warm feeling all around me. This heat. Like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace and he's shooting a bunch of fireballs at me! And the whole world is being engulfed in flames! You know what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days. You said it yourself! He's the baddest man on the planet! I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world! Okay! But what can I do to feel better?  Pound away.  Ow! Toph ... I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me! Thanks for everything, guys.  Uh, I kinda think I sorta might slightly feel a little better. Maybe.  It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.  No. That won't help. Nothing helps. There's only one thing I can do! I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion! Invasion. All aboard for the invasion. I told you, I can't go back to sleep.  Actually, staying up all night has given me some time to think. And I've realized some big things, Katara. I see everything so clearly now. What really matters. Why I'm really doing this. I'm doing it to save the world. But more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. I'm doing it for you, Katara. I'm saying, I love you!  What our hearts have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby, you're my forever girl.   Oh, I guess I kinda drifted off into a daydream.  Uh, living underwater? Put 'em up, Fire Lord!  Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach. You think you're untouchable, don't you, Mr. Fire Lord? Momo, did you hear something?  That's more like it. I'm so tired that for a second there, I imagined you were talking to me. Oh, Momo, let me explain.   Look, I appreciate what you guys are saying, but the stress and the nightmares. They were just too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it. You guys, come on. Sokka, what do we do?  About that! Come on, guys. We're all on the same side. I just need to jump in a cold waterfall! Oh, look. Another hallucination. An imaginary bed made out of clouds. Look! You guys keep telling me that I need to sleep, but I can't! The invasion's tomorrow! No, Katara! There's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me!  You really think so?  Thanks, guys. You know what? I think I am ready. Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord!  No, Fire Lord Ozai. You're> not wearing any pants.  I can't believe it. I know the War has spread far, but Omashu always seemed ... untouchable. No, I'm going in to find Bumi.  What? If he's still what? This isn't about finding a teacher. This is about finding my friend. That answer your question?  Shh! Stop making so much noise. It's just a purple pentapus. Thank you, sewer friends. Somewhere he can't earthbend. Somewhere made of metal. So, is King Bumi with you guys? Is he leading the resistance? Actually there's another path to freedom. You could leave Omashu. You're directing all your energy to fight the Fire Nation. But you're outnumbered. You can't win. Now's the time to retreat, so you can live to fight another day.  No. I'm not leaving until I find Bumi. Sorry Momo, I'll feed you later. Flopsie! Come on, Flopsie. You gotta help me find Bumi. Yip Yip! Oh ... I guess that doesn't work with you. Let's go!  We looked everywhere. No Bumi. It's from the Fire Nation governor. He thinks we kidnapped his son. So ... he wants to make a trade. His son for King Bumi. I don't think so. I'm sure the governor wants his son back as much as we want Bumi. It's a new day. I have a good feeling about this. He's here. We're ready to trade. Bumi! Hang on! We're gonna get you out of here. It's just like old times, isn't it, Bumi? It's good to see you too! Hang on, Bumi! Our ride's here!  You could earthbend? All along?  I don't understand. Why didn't you free yourself? Why did you surrender when Omashu was invaded? What's the matter with you, Bumi?  I know! There's positive jing when you're attacking, and negative jing when you're retreating.  There are three jings?  That's why you surrendered, isn't it?  I guess I need to find someone else to teach me earthbending.  Hey, Momo! Not if we can stop it!  Toph, let's make a trench to stop the fire from coming any closer.  Keep an eye on Momo. Sokka, stand clear! Good work, everybody. These people have no idea how close they were to getting toasted last night. Yeah, and who keeps us laughing with sarcastic comments all the time? I mean, look at Katara's hair, right? What's up with that?  Nothing. I was just trying to ...  What do you think? Pretty slick, huh? All I need to complete the outfit is a wind sword. It's where I get a sword handle and then I just swing this around and bend air out like a blade. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. I'll just stick to what I got.  That's it! That's what you needed all along, Sokka. Not the sword, a master. We've all had masters to help us get better. You should see if you can study with Piandao. What should we do today‌? Twice?  How hot is it? I guess the jokes don't run in the family.  No, we're over on this island. Sokka!  Say something funny! How did you know‌? The White Lotus. Huh. Where are we, Momo? Maybe I'm in the Spirit World? But wait. You can see me. We could both be in the Spirit World. Nope. My bending works. Maybe if we climb to the top of the island, we can figure out where we are. It's a hexagon. It doesn't seem like normal rock. It's not made of earth. This is so strange. I wish I had some help right now. I wish I had Roku. I do have Roku!   So where am I, Roku? What is this place? I am. I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord. Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life, but I just don't know if I can do that. Avatar Kyoshi. I need your wisdom.  You didn't really kill Chin. Technically, he fell to his own doom because he was too stubborn to get out of the way.  I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi. I need to look deep inside myself.  All these past Avatars. They keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it. You're right. Maybe an Air Nomad Avatar will understand where I'm coming from. I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think. I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that. Avatar Yangchen, the monks always taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web.  I know, I'm even a vegetarian. I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever. And I've only had to use violence for necessary defense. And I've certainly never used it to take a life. But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free.  I guess I don't have a choice, Momo. I have to kill the Fire Lord. Wait. Is it just me, or are those mountains getting bigger? They're not getting larger, They're getting closer! The whole island is moving! It's amazing Momo! The biggest animal in the world! I've gotta to swim around and find its face.   A lion turtle! Maybe you can help me. Everyone, even my own past lives, are expecting me to end someone's life. But I don't know if I can do it.  Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world, and now you shall pay the ultimate price! No, I'm not gonna end it like this. I took away your firebending. You can't use it to hurt or threaten anyone else ever again. I learned there was another way to defeat him and restore balance. I took his bending away. A giant lion turtle. And now we're friends. I can't believe a year ago I was still frozen in a block of ice. The world's so different now.  Okay, Roku. There it is. That's Roku's home.  Where're we going?  You were friends with Fire Lord Sozin‌? You don't have to tell me. Wait, whose party is it?  Hey, we're almost at the Southern Air Temple! No way! He's air surfing! I can't believe I never thought of that.  That's amazing! I can't believe you were friends with Monk Gyatso just like I was!  Roku, it's that girl who didn't even know you're alive! This is amazing, Roku! You're battling a volcano, and you're winning. Who's ... wait, that's me, isn't it?  Roku? Roku!  No, that's wrong. I don't think that was the point of what Roku showed me at all.  Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil. Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. And I also think it was about friendships.  I don't see why not.  Yeah. We were on the ship and there was this booby trap, and, well -- -- we booby-ed right into it.  Don't blame Katara. I brought her there. It's my fault.  You should try it sometime.  I am? Great!  Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family. Thanks for penguin sledding with me. Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders. Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to that.> It was nice meeting everyone.  Come on Appa, you can do it. Yip-yip!  I'll miss you, too. Come on, boy.  Yeah, I liked her too. The village! Appa, wait here.  Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka. Looking for me?  Well, you're just a teenager. If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?  Don't worry, Katara. It'll be okay. Take care of Appa for me until I get back.  So, I guess you've never fought an airbender before. I bet I could take you both >with my hands tied behind my back. You haven't seen my staff around, have you?  Thanks anyway!  Sorry! My staff!  Appa!  Hey, Katara. Hey, Sokka. Thanks for coming.  I dropped my staff.  I don't know. I just sort of ... did it. Because ... I never wanted to be.  And how am I going to do that?  That's what the monks told me.  We can learn it together!  All right, but before I learn waterbending, we have some serious business to attend to. Here, here and here.  Here, we'll ride the hopping llamas. Then waaay over here, we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. Then back over here, we'll ride the hog monkeys. They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun! Nah, just a nightmare. I was in the Avatar State, but I was outside my body watching myself. It was scary. I was scary.  Appa, yip yip!  I try not to think about it too much.  What? No I'm not! See, it's this special state where-  Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there. General Fong? I'm in. I'll fight the Fire Lord.  I told the general I'd help him, by going into the Avatar State. Katara, I'm just being realistic! I don't have time to do this the right way! Ten-fold energy, huh?  Is it working? Is it working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar State 'cause I don't have a good view of myself! Am I talking too loud? I love surprises!  Still not glowing.  This is just mud! Sure. I'm really glad you told me that. But I still need to do this.  No, you don't. Every day, more and more people die. I'm already one hundred years late. Defeating the Fire Lord is the only way to stop this war. I have to try it!  Good night.  Sokka! Sokka, wake up. I don't think we should be trying to bring on the Avatar State. Yes. Do you think the general will be mad?  The thing is, I don't think we'll ever be able to trigger it on purpose. So I guess that's it. I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar State when I'm in genuine danger.  What are you doing?  I'm not your enemy! I won't fight you! You can't fight forever!  Don't hurt her!  Stop this! You have to let her go!  I'm trying ... I'm trying!  You don't need to do this! What do you mean?  I'm sorry, Katara. I hope you never have to see me like that again.  You're out of your mind. What happened? Oh no!  Momo? Are you sure? I feel like I'm dreaming. Sokka?  Why are we on a Fire Nation ship? Why is everyone dressed this way? And why am I the only one who's completely out of it?  I have hair? How long was I out?  Nice to officially meet you, Chief Hakoda. Are you mad at your dad or something?  Mmm, a little higher. Uhhh! Wow, you're definitely in the right area there. I went down! I didn't just get hurt, did I? It was worse than that. I was gone! But you brought me back.  You saved me. So what now? Me? The world thinks I'm dead? How is that good news? That's terrible! No, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. This is so messed up! I'll handle this. The Avatar is back.  I hate not being able to do anything. I just can't stand by and do nothing!  Fine.   Well, I am pretty hungry. Maybe dinner's a good idea. I'm not going out if I can't wear my arrow proudly!  You're right, I don't. But the problem is, I did fail!  It is true. I was in Ba Sing Se. I was there! But I lost. And now the Earth Kingdom is fallen for good. And I hate the invasion plan, too! I don't want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes! I've always known that I would have to face the Fire Lord. But now I know I need to do it alone. Katara, please! Just go ... please. I need to redeem myself. I need my honor back. A blockade. I'm not gonna make it. I failed. Roku? But everyone thinks I'm dead again. They think I've abandoned them, and I'm losing this war. I'm letting the whole world down. I don't know.  You're right. I won't give up. I have so much to do. What about the invasion? It's okay. If someone saw it, it would give away my identity. It's better for now that no one knows I'm alive.  What? I'm wearing trunks.  Whoa! Let's go again!   We can't! Jump on Appa! I'll try to distract him! I'm okay.  Look! There's a coupon on the back! The first lesson is free. Ehhh, he's not the one.  Excuse me, but where is this earthbending tournament, exactly?  How'd you get them to tell you? Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here.  I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think, Sokka?  I think she is. She waited ... and listened. I will!  I don't really want to fight you. I want to talk to you. Please, wait!  Please, listen! I need an earthbending teacher, and I think it's supposed to be you! Wait! If we want to find the Blind Bandit, the Earthbending Academy is a great place to start. We need to talk to her. Do you guys know where she lives? That's because we're asking about the wrong person. In my vision, I saw a girl, in a white dress, with a pet flying boar. Know anybody like that? A flying boar is good enough for me. Let's check it out. That's the flying boar from my vision. Come on! How did you know it was me? Well, a crazy king told me I had to find an earthbender who listens to the earth. And then I had a vision in a magic swamp, and - Allow me.  I'd like to defeat the Fire Lord by the end of summer, but I can't do that without finding an earthbending teacher first.  Then she must be a great earthbender! Probably good enough to teach someone else! Ow! Oh, I'm sure she's better than you think she is.  What's your problem? Good night, buddy.  That's amazing. Is that why you became the Blind Bandit? Then why stay here where you're not happy? You could come with us. Go, I'll be okay. Hit it harder! I'm sorry, Toph.  Not like her. Toph! What are you doing here? You're going to be a great teacher, Toph. Okay. How's Sokka doing? I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea. But I found a map. There's an herbalist institute on top of that mountain. We could probably find a cure for Sokka there. Not you too!  That's how Sokka started yesterday. Now look at him! He thinks he's an earthbender! A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense, too. I'm going to go find some medicine! Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. Keep an eye on them guys.   Hello, I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I need some medicine for my friends, they have fevers and they were coughing-  That's nice. That's nice. Are you almost done?  Finally! Thanks for all your help! Ow!  Taking the cure to my friends. What about my friends?  What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?  Suck on them? You're insane, aren't you? Uh ... I think you dropped this ... A frog!  I've never hidden from you! Untie me and I'll fight you right now!  What? No! Don't leave, frogs! My friends are sick and they need you! Please go back to being frozen! Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me? I'll take that as a "yes." My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out! Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs! Stay close to me! Take this. Jump on my back! Give me the next one!  You know what the worst part of being born over a hundred years ago is? I miss all the friends I used to hang out with. Before the war started, I used to always visit my friend Kuzon. The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together. He was one of the best friends I ever had, and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you. If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends, too? Suck on these. They'll make you feel better. No, I don't think I did. I like jokes.  Nobody else has homework. One hot squat, two hot squat, three hot squat, four hot squat ... Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.  I need to ask you something ... Please ... come closer.  Will you go penguin sledding with me?  What's going on here?  I'm not sure.  Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.  Ha, ha! You're okay! This is Appa, my flying bison.  Don't worry, it'll wash out. So do you guys live around here? I'm A ... a-a-a-Achoo! I'm Aang.   Really? It felt higher than that. Sure am! Well, if you guys are stuck, Appa and I can give you a lift.  Okay, first time flyers, hold on tight! Appa, yip-yip! Come on, Appa. Yip-yip!  Appa's just a little tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.  Oh, I was smiling?  Hey. What'cha thinkin' about? Oh, no. I didn't know him. I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry.  Sleep tight.  Uh, why are they all looking at me like that? Did Appa sneeze on me?  Extinct?  It's not for stabbing! It's for airbending.  Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.  Check again!  You're a waterbender?  See? Now my tongue is stuck to my staff!  Wow! Everything freezes in there!  What war? What are you talking about?  Penguin!  Hey, come on little guy. Wanna go sledding? Heh heh. I have a way with animals.  You got a deal! Just one little problem ... I'm an airbender, not a waterbender. Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you? This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water. What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right? Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you. But you forget, I have a flying bison. Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole. Katara, we're going to find you a master! Well, you think about it, but in the meantime, can you teach me catch one of these penguins? Hi hi hi! Ha, ha, ha! You still are a kid!  Whoa! What is that?> If you want to be a bender, you have to let go of fear. Okay, back up. I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen any war.  I don't know. A few days, maybe?  What?! That's impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you? A hundred years! I can't believe it.  I did get to meet you. Huh? What's that you said about booby traps? Uh oh ... Hold on tight! So you were showing me the octopus form?  Oh, yea ... thanks. Just ... people.  You guys are nomads? That's great! I'm a nomad!  I know ... you just said that.  Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere! They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler! Yeah, thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground. And we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable ...  So all you need to do is trust in love to get through these caves?  We can make it. Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map also.  We found the exit!  No. It's a tomb. It must be the two lovers from the legend; that's who's buried here. How are we going to find our way out of these tunnels?  What? Katara, what is it? Right ...  Where are you going with this?  Us ... kissing‌>?  Us ... kissing ...  Yeah. I definitely wouldn't want to kiss you!   No, no, I mean ... if there was a choice between kissing you and dying ...  What? I'm saying is I would rather kiss you than die - that's a compliment.  What is wrong with me ... We're going to run out of light any second now, aren't we? Then, what are we going to do? They're made of some kind of crystal. They must only light up in the dark. So, uh ... What about Sokka? Just like the legend said, we let love lead the way.  So are you guys going to come to Omashu with us? Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku.  That's not gross, it's just a part of spring! You know, rebirth, flowers blooming and Appa gets a new coat.  And a great beard!   Sorry! What is it? Better safe than sorry. Should we do something?  Okay, okay, you both need to calm down.  I ... can see that.   I don't think so, Sokka.  I don't know. But this time, I'm going to make sure we lose it. Come on guys, there's something after us and we don't even know what or who it is. That's impossible. There's no way they could have tracked us.  Maybe we should face them. Find out who they are. Who knows, maybe they're friendly. Appa, yip yip!  Sokka, we'll be okay. We can't keep flying forever.  So what's our plan? Appa fell asleep!  Wake up, buddy! Appa's exhausted.  All right, all right, everyone's exhausted! Let's just get some rest.  No! No, she's not blaming you.  What? You're blaming Appa?  How dare you blame Appa! He saved your life three times today! If there's anyone to blame it's you! You're always talking about how you carry your own weight, but you're not. He is! Appa's carrying your weight. He never had a problem flying when it was just the three of us! What did I just do? I can't believe I yelled at my earthbending teacher. Now she's gone.  I have a plan. Toph was right. The fur was leaving a trail right to us. But now that he's clean, no more trail. He'll be fine as long as we leave his saddle and all our stuff here. I'm going to use Appa's fur to make a fake trail to lead the tank off-course. All right, you've caught up with me. Now, who are you and what do you want? So what now?  I'm not running.  Zuko!  "Zuzu"?  Katara! I don't know. In my vision, I just knew she needed help. Uh ... I'm great! It went great with the guru. I completely mastered the Avatar State. Yeah. But, in my vision, I felt so sure she was in trouble. Okay. Maybe you're right. Momo! Katara is in trouble! I knew it! You guys know each other? She must have Katara. Then we'll work together to fight Azula, and save Katara and Zuko. Katara's in trouble. All of Ba Sing Se is in trouble. Working together is our best chance. So, Toph thinks you give pretty good advice, and great tea! Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this great power, but to do it, I had to let go of someone I love. And I just couldn't.  What happens if we can't save anyone and beat Azula? Without the Avatar State, what if I'm not powerful enough? Saving you, that's what. There's too many.  I'm sorry, Katara.  Top of the morning, Momo!  Like a baby moose lion. I'm ready to face the Fire Lord.  I can't. When Azula shot me with lightning, my seventh chakra was locked, cutting off my connection to all the cosmic energy in the universe.   Toph, this is Haru. When we met him, his town was controlled by the Fire Nation. So he had to hide his earthbending. A new glider! This is amazing! Oh ... well, I'm sure that will come in handy. We've been looking everywhere for you. The boats are ready to leave. What?  Sokka, that speech wasn't your moment of truth. That was just public speaking, and nobody's really good at that. Look, your moment of truth isn't gonna be in front of some map; it's gonna be out there on the battlefield. Because I already failed the world once at Ba Sing Se. I won't let myself fail again.  So, this is it huh? I'm ready.   Katara, I ... You go first. Everything's gonna be different after today, isn't it. What if ... what if I don't come back? What do you know? It did come in handy.  That's strange. The Avatar is back! Hello? Anyone home? No. No, no, no! Fire Lord Ozai, where are you!?  How could you let them take Appa?! ‌ Why didn't you stop them‌?!  You could've come to get us. I could've saved him!  You just didn't care! You never liked Appa! You wanted him gone! That's all any of you guys care about, yourselves! You don't care whether Appa is okay or not!  I'm going after Appa. Appa! Appa! No ... No!  What's the difference? We won't survive without Appa. We all know it.  It doesn't matter. None of those will tell us where Appa is. I'm awake. I couldn't sleep.  Appa!  I'm sorry, okay! It's a desert cloud; I did all I could! What's anyone else doing?! What are you doing‌?!  Maybe we can find some sandbenders. Yeah ... look at the shape. Momo! I'm not losing anyone else out here.  You stole Appa! Where is he? ‌What did you do to him?  Where is my bison‌? You tell me where he is now!  You muzzled Appa‌?  Tell me where Appa is! I bet we'll find something to eat here, the Fire Day's Festival. Fire Nation cultural exhibits, jugglers, benders, magicians ... This would be a great place for me to study some real firebenders.  Hey, a poster of me!  I have to learn firebending at some point and this could be my only chance to watch a master's up close.  You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival. Ready disguises! Let's go. Hey, there's some food. Hey, look at this. I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good. I gotta learn that trick!  Oh! Oh! Me! Me! I want to get a closer look.  Awww! That could've been me. We gotta help her! I'm calling Appa.  Appa! Down here! Nice touch setting off the fireworks. You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord? We've gotta go see him! He can train me! Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me. Is that where Jeong Jeong is? I need to talk to him right away. What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now? Why won't he see me?  Wait, how does he know that? I'm going in, anyway! Master, I need to learn firebending.  I'm the Avatar, it's my destiny to—  Okay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines. Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance. Really? That's great!  Wait! What do I do now? But what am I concentrating on? So when do I get to make some fire? Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts? What? You brought me up here to breathe? You're not even look—  I've been breathing for hours! I want you to stop wasting my time! I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun! I wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips! I thought about what you said, I promise I'll be more patient. Oh yeah! I mean, let us begin. What's going on?  This is the worst >firebending instruction ever! All he does is leave me for hours to concentrate or breathe! But I'm ready to do so much more.  I did it! I made fire! Now that's> some firebending! I wonder how that juggler did it. Katara! I'm so sorry! It was an accident! I was, uh... Katara, I'm so-- I'm sorry, I didn't ... I'm sorry!  Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again. No, never again.  What? How?  Where? I have to help him! Jeong Jeong!  You were Jeong Jeong's student?! Whoa! Wild shot! No self-control ...   Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up! Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!  Ahoy! I'm Admiral Zhao! I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko. Sloppy. Very sloppy.  You've lost this battle. No, but you have. Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint. Have a nice walk home! Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong? Wow, that's good water.  Two? I was, but something stopped me. Something big.  That. I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever is in charge. Not needed? The question is, how are we going to stop that thing?  You're the idea guy.  We'll take it down from the inside. Where are we going to get something like that? What are you doing? Someone's going to hear us! I don't know how many more of those I have in me.  Maybe we don't need to cut all the way through. Toph has been teaching me that you shouldn't give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike. Sokka, take a fighting stance. You've got to be quick and accurate. Hit a series of points and break your opponent's stance. And when he's reeling back, you deliver the final blow. His own weight becomes his downfall, literally. Then I'll go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow. Everyone inside that wall. The whole world is counting on us. That's enough! We need to get to the next one!  Whoa! Guys, get out of here. I know what I need to do.  This looks like a good spot, Momo. General Sung, tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here!  What I'd give to be a metalbender.  Momo, get out of here! Thanks, Momo. I owe you one. Now all I need ... Actually, that is what I need for once.  I kind of like that one. I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy.  But now that we have Appa back, there's nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth. About the conspiracy and the War. We need to talk to you.  See? We're friends, Your Earthiness.   Over here.   Well, sir, there's a war going on right now. For the past one hundred years in fact. The Dai Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you. Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes; he brainwashed our friend! Right there! Appa bit him! Oh, yeah. If you come with us to the Outer Wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real. I wish it wasn't.  It's still there!  We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable. Secret files?  It's from the Eastern Air Temple. I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a guru. No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.  Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together! Now you want us to separate? Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple, Appa and I can drop you off at Chameleon Bay to see your dad. Katara? I need to tell you something. I've been wanting to say it for a long time.  Katara, I-  Yeah.  Yeah. Girls are waiting for us. Thanks, positive attitude.  Hey, uh ... I wanted to sit there. I was just, I wanted to ... okay.  Wait, is that a woman playing me?  I don't do that! That's not what I'm like! And I'm not a woman!  Ugh. Ugh!  At least the Sokka actor kind of looks like you. That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all!  Argh!  Yeah, that's not you at all.  No, I'm not! I hate this play!  Overreacting? If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State right now! Katara, did you really mean what you said in there? On stage, when you said I was just like a ... brother to you, and you didn't have feelings for me. But it's true, isn't it? We kissed at the Invasion, and I thought we were gonna be together. But we're not. Why don't you know? Well, when is the right time? Ugh, I'm such an idiot!  I'll say.  Okay. Not something to fear. Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration?  I thought it was ... nice.   Maybe it's the altitude.  That one kind of felt hot. Sorry, Sifu Hotman. I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to. That's amazing, Toph!  I learned from the monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison. Maybe you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy.  What do you mean‌? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of dragons when I was a kid. Okay, okay. I'm sorry.  Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't around when I was a kid. It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt by the present.  Appa's right, Zuko. In our group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude.  Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it.  Okay. We've learned something about architecture. Hopefully, we'll learn something about firebending too. The past can be a great teacher.  Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill me. There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here. Look, this seems promising. Though I'm not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending.  I thought the dragons were friends with the Sun Warriors. Zuko, something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years. Something you're not telling me.  But I thought your uncle was ... I don't know, good? It's locked up!  Monkeyfeathers! The solstice again? We can't wait here that long. Nothing's happening.  You know, Zuko, I don't care what everyone else says about you. You're pretty smart. It says this is something called the Dancing Dragon. Zuko, get over here! I want you to dance with me! Just do it. Let's follow the steps of the statues. Don't you see? These aren't dance moves. These statues are giving us a lesson. I think this is some kind of Sun Warrior firebending form. Hurray! Wait, what exactly is that?  Well, don't touch it!  Remember what happened out there with those spikes? I'm just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals.  Oh no, it's another trap!  I can't move! Zuko, do something! It stopped. You had to pick up the glowing egg, didn't you?  Help! Well, what do you think we should do? Please, I don't normally play this card, but ... I'm the Avatar. Just hear us out.  Ran and Shaw? There are two of them?  Umm, Mister Sun Chief Sir‌, yeah, I'm not a firebender yet. Couldn't my friend here carry my fire for me? I'm sorry, I'm just a little nervous. It's like a little heartbeat. I can't. If I walk too fast, my flame will go out.   But what if I can't control it? But once they find out I'm the Avatar ...  We could turn back now. We've already learned more about fire than we'd hoped.   What if they judge us, and attack us? What's happening‌? Zuko, my fire went out. Give me some of yours.   I can't.   Quit being stingy! Uh oh.  Still think we can take 'em?  Zuko, I think we're supposed to do the Dragon Dance with them. Well, I think they want us to do something. Let's just try it. Wow.  Like firebending harmony.  So your uncle lied.  All this time, I thought firebending was destruction. Since I hurt Katara, I've been too afraid and hesitant. But now I know what it really is ... it's energy, and life.   With this technique the dragons showed us, Zuko and I will be unstoppable.  Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka.   Not tangled. Woven! I made you a necklace, Katara. I thought since you lost your other one ... I don't see why I can't do both.  You mean, all of you or just your neck? I mean, because they both look great!  I ... well, uh ...  Thanks.  Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear! Make noise! He'll run off! And then run in zig-zags!  Whoa there! Aunt who? What do you know? An umbrella! Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.  Hello.  Aang.  I guess. Likewise.  Good luck with that!  I'm good on puffs. So, what do you think they're talking about back there?  Yeah, dumb stuff like that ... Well, I've got to find a bathroom. Yeah ... when I was in there ... Wow, that's a big crack.  Yeah, yeah, I knew that already. But did it say anything about a girl?  Yes! Really? Thank you, Aunt Wu!  They sure are ...  Some stuff. You'll find out.  That cloud kind of looks like a fluffy bunny.  Huh? Sure, I guess. Hey, Katara, don't you think that cloud look like a flower?  Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you. I like you, but more than normal.  Never mind. They seem happy, Sokka. So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right? Well, there's this girl.  You do? And you're okay with it?  She does? Well, how do I do that? You can be too nice? Well, okay ... See you later ...   Oh, hey, Katara. I didn't see you there.  That's okay. I'm busy with my own stuff.  So ... papaya.  You know me. I don't really care what I eat.  Maybe aloof isn't my style.  Did you see that? Excuse me. Where can a guy find one of those things? Not just any flower, a panda lily. I've seen it in action and boy, does it work. But my heart is telling me to get this flower, and Aunt Wu said if I trusted in my heart, I will be with the one I love.  Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet. Why should she be wrong about love? There! On the rim!  Oh no. Aunt Wu was wrong. There's no time to walk! Grab on!   Hi, Katara. But she doesn't even charge.  Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here! You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction, you have to take fate into your own hands!  But they will listen to Aunt Wu! Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands. First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.  Shhh! We don't want anyone to hear us. Oh, I didn't see you there. Of course I like you. Oh, I guess not.  I know what you mean.  Huh? Don't worry. You're going to meet a great guy who's going to completely fall for you. I know it.  How did you know?  Oh, thanks ... I guess. Clouds are made of water and air, so between the two of us, we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want. We still can save the village if we act fast. Sokka has a plan. If any of you are earthbenders, come with me. Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!  By the way, we kind of borrowed your book. Can I ask you something?  You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you? You just told me what I wanted to hear. Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the- hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?  Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?  You see that? Settling feuds and making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar. Come on, Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs.  There it is, guys, The Great Divide. I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding for a hundred years. Uh, you could share the earthbender and travel together?  All right here's the deal, you're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across! Does that seem fair?   Sorry, Appa, you'll have to do this on your own.  To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. But when have I ever been?  Appa's going to take good care of you 'till we get there. See you on the other side, buddy! Yip yip!  Nice bending! Why'd you do that?  What was that? We're trapped in this canyon. Look, sticking together is the only way to-  Any ideas?  Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along, but I guess that's not gonna happen. We should split up, Gan Jins on this side and Zhangs on that side. We'll travel in two separate lines. Sokka, you go with the Zhangs and Katara, you go with the Gan Jins. See if you can find out why they hate each other so much. Sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires, telling stories and laughing. Its okay Momo, we'll be out of here soon enough, and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts! Nah, I'll wait for the leechi nuts. I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible. Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.  Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon? What are you talking about?  Okay, okay I get it! Now I need your help, I need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall. Please everyone, as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways, but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.  Guys, focus! How many times do I have to say it? Harsh words won't solve problems, action will! You know, I take it back. Harsh words aren't so bad!  Is that ... food? Everyone smuggled food down here? Unbelievable! You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day? You're all awful! So hungry. Is that an egg custard in that tart?   Everybody, watch me and do what I do! Now follow me! We're riding out of this hole! Everyone, get off!  Wait a second ... Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys! No, I mean I really knew them. I might not look it, but I'm a hundred and twelve years old. I was there one hundred years ago on the day you're talking about. There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened. First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact, and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it. Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for twenty long years but for two short minutes. There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was just a game. Nope, just a regular ball. That's what the game was called, redemption. As soon as you got the ball from one end to the other, everyone would yell "redemption"! Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's differences enough to share the same playing field. Good to see you, boy. Did you miss me?   Well, you know I try. You could call it luck. Or you could call it lying. I made the whole thing up. Now where is that custard tart? I'm starving! You haven't seen your dad in over two years. You must be so excited! Don't be nervous. He's going to be so happy to see you!  Not at all. I'm ready to master the Avatar State. I'll do whatever it takes. See you in a week. Yip yip! Uhhh ... hello? You're Guru Pathik, right? The person who attached the note to Appa's horn? In your note, you said you could teach me how to gain control of the Avatar State. How?  Uggh! It tastes like onion and banana juice!  What are chakras? So chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies? The creek can't flow? The energy flows!   I'll do whatever it takes. Water Chakra?  I ran away. I hurt all of those people.  My Fire Chakra would like to eat something other than onion-banana juice. I'm never going to firebend again. I can't.  Tastes like onions and bananas, but strangely something else. Pickles?   Can I have some onion-banana juice, please? Because I never wanted to be.  Like the four nations. We're all connected. Everything is connected. This is the last chakra, isn't it?  Let's do this.  What? Why would I let go of Katara? I ... I love her! Why would I choose cosmic energy over Katara? How could it be a bad thing that I feel an attachment to her? Three chakras ago that was a good thing! I'm sorry, but I can't let go of Katara. Okay, I'll try. Katara's in danger! I have to go!   I think I see a cave below. Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. If we get Fire Nation disguises, we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave.  I don't know about this. These clothes belong to somebody. But if it's essential to our survival ... then I call the suit!   Ta-dah! Normal kid.  Uh ... your mom's necklace. I used to visit my friend Kuzon here a hundred years ago. So, everyone just follow my lead and stay cool. Or, as they say in the Fire Nation, "stay flamin'". Greetings, my good hotman.  Oh, we're going to a meat place? You guys go ahead. I'll just get some lettuce out of the garbage. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman. Hotman.  Who, me? That's right. Let the molding begin.  Yeah, the colonies, of course. The Fire Nation colonies in the Earth Kingdom.  Sorry, ma'am. Um ... I have a scar. It's really embarrassing.  Just "slob" is fine. Or, uh, Kuzon. .] [ We made it through the day Momo, and it was pretty fun.  What monkey? Wow. You must be one of those popular kids I've been hearing about.  It was nice meeting you. I guess I'm just lucky. I'd love to.  I got invited to play with some kids after school. I enrolled in a Fire Nation school, and I'm going back tomorrow. Every minute I'm in that classroom, I'm learning new things about the Fire Nation. I already have a picture of Fire Lord Ozai. And here's one that I made out of noodles!  I guess we'll never find out about the secret river then. It goes right to the Fire Lord's palace. We were supposed to learn about it in class tomorrow. Flamey-O, Hotman!   Fire Lord ... forefathers ... Firebenders ... Fire Lord ... wah, bah, blah, blah.  Is that a trick question? The Air Nomads didn't have a formal military. Sozin defeated them by ambush.  I'll just write down my best guess.  I know, I'm a terrible tsungi hornist. I was just dancing. You do dances here in the homeland, right? But what about expressing yourself? Thanks On Ji. I could show it to you again if you like. Ah!   Just some dance movements.  Parents? But- I'm not ready to leave yet. I'm having fun for once, just being a normal kid. You don't know what it's like, Sokka. You get to be normal all the time. Listen guys, those kids at school are the future of the Fire Nation. If we want to change this place for the better, we need to show them a little taste of freedom. I'm gonna throw them, a secret dance party!  Don't think of it as a dance party, but as a cultural event celebrating the art of fancy footwork!   Sorry buddy, you should probably wait out back. I know, you got fancier feet than anybody. And six of 'em!   Ladies and gentlemen, the Flamey-O's! Yeah, this ought to get everybody moving.  This is when you start dancing. Oh boy. Listen guys, dancing isn't something you think about. It's a form of self-expression that no one can ever take away from you. Sure you do, you have for generations! It just so happens that I know several classic Fire Nation dances. A hundred years ago, this was known as the 'Phoenix Flight'. And, this was the 'Camelephant Strut'. And this is how they do it in the ballrooms of Ba Sing Se.  Yeah, that's it! That's the sound of happy feet. All right, go with that! Everybody freestyle!  Take my hand. Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now. Uh-oh.  I don't know, it was just a dance party, that's all. The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu! I used to always come here to visit my friend Bumi.  Well let's go, slow pokes. The real fun's inside the city!  So what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?  Ugh. This is so itchy. How do you live in this stuff?  Now let's get to skippin', young whipper-snappers. The big city awaits! You guys are going to love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest in the world.  Just keep smiling!  My business is my business, young man, and none of yours! I've got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!  Name's Bonzu Pippinpaddleopsicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids.  Good idea!  This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.  Earthbending brings the packages up, and gravity brings them down.  They do get their mail on time, but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes.  Um ... The mail system?  A package-sending system?  Bumi, you're a mad genius!  One ride. Then we're off to the North Pole. Airbender's honor.  I'm on it!  Yeah! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster! Sorry!  Two cabbages please. Thanks, but I don't eat meat.  I'm from ... Kangaroo Island!  Okay, you caught me. I'm the Avatar. Doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe. Everything checks out. No firebenders here. So, good work, everybody! Love each other, respect all life, and don't run with your spears. We'll see you next time!  He did say it was newly refurbished.  I wonder what these challenges are gonna to be.  The air vents!  We can't, but Momo can!  Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here! Go on, boy, get Appa!  Appa's a ten-ton flying bison; I think he could figure something out.  Sokka? Katara? Where are my friends?  And if I fail?  I ... guess it's fine. Really?  I don't have time for your crazy games! Give me my friends back! We're leaving!  I'll do what you want. There! Enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back now! Okay! Found him! Come here, Flopsie. Huh? Flopsie, wait! Flopsie! Flopsie! Wait a minute. Flopsie? Flopsie!  Guys, are you okay? Come on! I'm ready for the next challenge. So ... you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight? I ... choose ... you.  Can I fight the guy with the axe instead? That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests. How am I supposed to know his name? Yeah? Okay. So back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall, I saved his pet, and I had a duel. Well, everything was different than I expected. Well, they weren't straight forward. To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. I know his name. I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges. As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities. Bumi, you're a mad genius. Thank you for your wisdom, but before we leave, I have a challenge for you.  Shh! I know you can see underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch. Yeah! I'm putting an orchestra together. I'm learning the elements as fast as I can. I practice hard every day with Toph and Katara. I've been training my arrow off!  Your turn, Katara. Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation? Oh, yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring. And I usually don't use the word "pristine". It's one of nature's wonders. Must've changed ownership since I was here.  No worries, I clean up easy.   Thanks, I try. The Southern Temple.  Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural product?  Wow, shouldn't be too hard to find a place like this out here.  Don't worry, buddy. I'm not making you go underground ever again. You can stay out here with Toph.  Nothing. We just like architecture. What do you have against humans? Ow. Uh, yeah, I'll vouch. We will not abuse the knowledge in your library, good spirit. You have my word.   Uh ... oh, I know! Hah!  Hey, look at these weird lion turtle things. I always knew I was special.  Sokka, where are you going?  Firebenders. Wow, I got to hand it to you, Sokka. You picked the best mini-vacation for sure.  Great, you must have broken it. We had no choice. Please, we're just desperate to protect the people we love. What are you doing?  We've gotta get back to the surface! Why are we doing this? You can't possibly check every single date.  Come on, eclipse.  Where's Appa?  Aren't airbender stories the greatest?  I laugh at gravity all the time. Gravity.  Hey! Thanks for the story.  It means a lot to hear airbender stories. It must have been a hundred years ago your great grandpa met them.  Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple. This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo.  Hey, guys, look at this!  No, they're not.  Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move, they're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.  Yeah, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding.  It's great.  Thanks.  This place is unbelievable. No, just unbelievable.  This is supposed to be the history of my people. Ugh! It's nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isn't ruined.  Do you know what you did!? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid bathhouse!  This whole place stinks!  This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way! I've seen it when the monks were here! I know what it's supposed to be like! What are you doing? Who said you could be here? Our gliders. Nature knows where to stop. I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.  I'm sorry. This is the last part of the temple that's the same as it was. I want it to stay that way. Thanks.  Spirit. Spirit. That's the something you're talking about. Just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!  Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one! I've been thinking. If you want to see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you. This is a nightmare.  You're making weapons for the Fire Nation! When are they coming? You can't give them more weapons. The deal's off. Get out of here! You're leaving empty-handed! I'll tell you how. We have something they don't. Air power. We control the sky. That's something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win! Good. We'll need it.  We'll have to start without it. We've got them on the run! We need more slime! Look! They're retreating!  You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now. I realized, it's like the hermit crab. Maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now you protect each other. Momo! Oh Momo! Hahahahaha! You found me, buddy! Hey guys, I think this river's polluted.  Hey, maybe we can get food there!  Now you look just like a little hill with horns! Bye, buddy! Thanks for the ride!  Let's just get what we need and go.  But we just saw you. You're even wearing the same clothes. The only difference is your hat. I don't get it. What? What's the matter Katara? He doesn't look sick. You okay, buddy? His tongue is purple! That can't be good. Katara, can you heal him? Yeah, are the people ... happier? Is that why this place seems so festive? Spirit magic doesn't work that way, Sokka. It's more like ...  What's the matter, buddy? It's her! Hello, Painted Lady Spirit!  Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but my friend's sick and we're on kind of a tight schedule. Wait! But I'm a great bridge between your world and mine! I know Hei Bai! We're close personal friends! Heeey! My name's Aang. I'm the Avatar.  Yeah, me too. I hate that. You know, you're really pretty, for a spirit. I don't meet too many spirits, but the ones I do meet, not very attractive.  You seem familiar too.  No, you really seem familiar. Katara?  You're the Painted Lady? But how? So you've been sneaking out at night? Wait, is Appa even sick? I can't believe you lied to everyone, so you could help these people.  No, I think it's great! You're like a secret hero! You wanna destroy this factory?  Hey, I just found out this morning! Fire Nation soldiers are heading toward the village!  He really does have a heart, doesn't he? Aha, I knew it! I knew you were the same guy. You're the shop owner and the boat guy.  No, I just saw you! You switched hats and called yourself a different name!  I think I like "the man with a sword for a hand" better.  All right, now I'm getting scared. I bet if we take a little walk around town, we'll find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad.  Helping people ... that's what I do.  She could be home any minute. Okay, that's pretty creepy. We shouldn't be doing this.  Guys, I don't know about this ...  Great ...  I'd steer clear of the sea prunes. Close enough. This has got to be the nicest natural setting in the Fire Nation. I don't see anything that would make a spirit mad around here.  Excuse me, sir. Can you tell us anything about the spirit that's been stealing people? Old Man Ding? Did you get a good look at the spirit that took you? I didn't know spirits made prisons like this. Who brought you here? We have to stop Hama! Give up! You're outnumbered! This feels weird! It's okay! Okay. I'm ready for some training. Are we taking a break?  Sokka, sneak attacks don't work if you yell it out loud. Uh guys, I thought we were supposed to be training me. Yeah!  So, guys. What are we gonna get with our last silver piece? Flamey-O, Toph. Toph got us money. She scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneaky-like.   Katara, I'll personally make you an Avatar Promise that we won't make a habit of doing these scams.  Wow, how does it work?  Well. I, uh-  Yes, ma'am. Sure.  I gotta say, Sokka, you continue to impress me with your ideas. I can't believe we forgot Toph can't write. I guess Plan B is we send a note to Toph pretending it's from Katara. Do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long? Where do you think anyone is? Sokka, watch out! It's Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man! We should split up. He can't chase us both. So, did you figure out what route we're going to take? Katara, it's okay. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar eclipse. So, you guys are headed to Ba Sing Se, too? Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please. Uh ... no one told us we had to have passports. That won't be necessary. Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around? I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me? I'll talk to the lady for you. But she's pregnant and all of her stuff was stolen! You have to make an exception! What if we gave them our tickets? But ... Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the Serpent's Pass. I don't know. The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do need to abandon it. Hope is not going to get us into Ba Sing Se and it's not going to help find Appa. We need to focus on what we're doing right now and that's getting across this path. You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't control myself. I hated feeling like that.  Thank you for your concern, Katara.   I'll distract it. Katara, get everyone across!   I've been going through a really hard time lately. But you've made me ... hopeful again. I thought I was trying to be strong. But really I was just running away from my feelings. Seeing this family together, so full of happiness and love, it's reminded me how I feel about Appa ... and how I feel about you. I promise, I'll find Appa as fast as I can. I just really need to do this. I know. Thank you, Katara. You ready, Momo?  Sorry Momo, Appa's going to have to wait.  Yes, Master Pakku?  I wouldn't say mastered, but check this out. I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people. I'm going to make a difference this time. Yip-yip! I'll take it from here, boy.  Appa! Thanks for the rescue, buddy!  You've got to be kidding me ...  I can't do it ... I can't do it.  I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships, but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.  I'm just one kid.  The spirits! Maybe I can find them and get their help!  Or maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation! Or wisdom. That's good, too.  So, is this the way to the Spirit World?  I never thought I'd miss grass this much! You're right, Yue. I can feel ... something. It's so tranquil.   How about some quiet? Come on guys, I can hear every word you're saying! Hello? I'm sorry to disturb you. I just really need to find the Moon and the Ocean Spirits. Yes, I need - Come back!  Roku! Roku, the Water Tribe's under attack. I need to find the Ocean and the Moon Spirits. Who? You're just a curly tailed blue nose.  Aaahhh! Show no fear. Show no emotion at all. Hello? I-I'm looking for a spirit named 'Koh'.  Thank you.  You know me?  I didn't know that. Why did he, or I, try to kill you? I need to find the moon and the ocean.  Please. Help me find them. An entire culture could be destroyed if I don't get their help.  What do you mean? How can I find them and protect them?  The koi fish! I must be going now. The spirits are in trouble, I need to get back to the physical world.  Hei Bai! This is where I came in, but how do I get back? Momo! Momo. Oh no, where's my body?  It's good to be back.  Appa! We need to get to the oasis; the spirits are in trouble! Wait, we can't just leave him here. No, if we leave him he'll die.  I feel it, too. The Moon Spirit is in trouble.  Zhao, don't!  Destroying the moon won't hurt just the Water Tribe. It will hurt everyone, including you. Without the moon, everything would fall out of balance. You have no idea what kind of chaos that would unleash on the world.   No, it's not over. Come here.  Wait 'til you see it, Katara! The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world!  That's why I'm so excited!  I know, but I need to see it for myself.  Wake up, Sokka! Air Temple, here we come!   Sokka! Wake up! There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!  Great! You're awake! Let's go!  Oh. That was food? I used it to start the campfire last night. Sorry.  The Patola Mountain range! We're almost there!  What about 'em?  Just because no one has seen an airbender, doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all. They probably escaped!  You don't understand, Katara. The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison, and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison! Right, Appa? Yip yip!  There it is. The Southern Air Temple.  We're home, buddy! We're home.   So that's where my friends and I would play airball, and over there is where the bison would sleep, and ...   This place used to be full of monks and lemurs and bison. Now there's just a bunch of weeds. I can't believe how much things have changed.  Aang, seven! Sokka, zero!  Okay!  What is it? Nice one! But enough practicing, we have a whole temple to see!  Hey guys! I want you to meet somebody!  Monk Gyatso! The greatest airbender in the world. He taught me everything I know.  Hmm ...  This whole Avatar thing, m-maybe the monks made a mistake.  But Gyatso? How do I know if I'm ready for this?  Who is it?  All right.  Yeah.   The air temple sanctuary. There's someone I'm ready to meet.  It's not impossible. I survived in the iceberg for that long.  Katara, whoever's in there might help figure out this Avatar thing!  The key, Sokka, is airbending.  Hello? Anyone home?  I'm not sure. But it feels like I know them somehow. Look! That one's an airbender. That's the Avatar Cycle. Wow! There are so many!  Huh? That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me. I'm not sure. I just know it somehow.  Lemur!  Don't listen to him. You're going to be my new pet. Wait! Come back!  Hey! Come back! Come on out, little lemur! That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.  Firebenders? They were here?  Gyatso.  I'm sorry.  But you were right. And if the firebenders found this temple, that means they found the other ones, too. I really am the last airbender.  How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him? Looks like you made a new friend Sokka!  Hey, little guy!  You, me and Appa; we're all that's left of this place. We have to stick together. Katara, Sokka, say hello to the newest member of our family. Momo.  What are you doing?  Zuko! No! I can't get him to go in there! Appa hates tunnels! We'll have to find a way! We'll get through. Let's go. Wow, camping ... it really seems like old times again, doesn't it?  Why? Is it your turn to take a little field trip with Zuko?  Oh. What's going on? Um ... and what exactly do you think this will accomplish? Wait! Stop! I do understand. You're feeling unbelievable pain and rage. How do think I felt about the sandbenders when they stole Appa? How do you think I felt about the Fire Nation when I found out what happened to my people? I don't think so. I think it's about getting revenge. Katara, you sound like Jet. The monks used to say that revenge is like a two-headed rat viper. While you watch your enemy go down, you're being poisoned yourself. Katara, you do have a choice: forgiveness. No, it's not. It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to forgive. So you were just gonna take Appa anyway? It's okay, because I forgive you. That give you any ideas? I wasn't planning to. This is a journey you need to take. You need to face this man. But when you do, please don't choose revenge. Let your anger out, and then let it go. Forgive him. Thanks, Sokka. I appreciate that.  Why do you need Momo? Katara? Are you okay? Zuko told me what you did. Or what you didn't do, I guess. I'm proud of you. You did the right thing. Forgiveness is the first step you have to take to begin healing. It never is.  I need you, too.  Be careful, guys! Guys?  Gyatso?  I didn't mean to.  It's nothing. I just had a bad dream. Go back to sleep.  I'm okay.  I think I just need some rest. Look at those clear skies, buddy! Should be some smooth flying.  I think it's true, Katara. Swishing means it's ripe.  Maybe we should find some shelter? Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky.  I'm sorry for running away. Actually, he wasn't.  I don't want to talk about it. Well, it's kind of a long story. I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar. I was playing with some other kids just outside the South Wall. I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter. First you got to form the ball, then you got to get on quick. You kind of have to balance on it like it's a top. I made it up. How do you know it's me? Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!  I just chose them because they seemed fun. Well, I didn't know how to feel about it. All I knew was that after I found out, everything began changing. Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing! Great! What's going on? But I'm still the same! Nothing's changed! So, what? I can't play? Oh, okay. What do you mean? Hey! Then, just when I was feeling better, something worse happened.  How could they do that to me? They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!  I'm sorry I got so mad. Well, that's not exactly what happened. I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do.  I never saw Gyatso again. Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg. And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple. My people needed me and I wasn't there to help. The world needed me and I wasn't there to help. The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world! You don't know that. I'm going to find him! We'll be back soon. I promise. Come on, Appa! The boat! There! Hang onto the rope. He doesn't have to apologize. Actually, I don't eat meat. Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past. I can't make guesses about what would have turned out if I hadn't run away. I'm here now and I'm going to make the most out of it. Appa!  What? I didn't even notice.  I know this is going to sound weird, but I think the swamp is calling to me. No, I ... I think it wants us to land there. I don't know. Bumi said to learn earthbending I would have to wait and listen, and now I'm actually hearing the earth. Do you want me to ignore it?  Okay, since everyone feels so strongly about this, bye swamp. Yip, Yip!  Where's Appa and Momo? Appa! Momo!  No, and the tornado ... it just disappeared.  Maybe we should be a little nicer to the swamp. Sokka, the longer we're here, the more I think you shouldn't be doing do that. Except for them. Guys? Katara! Appa! Hello? Who are you? Hey, come back!  Who are you?  I was chasing some girl.  I don't know. I heard laughing and I saw some girl in a fancy dress. What about me? I didn't know the girl I saw. And all our visions led us right here. Yeah, the center ... it's the heart of the swamp. It's been calling us here. I knew it.  Why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us!?  We were flying over and I heard something calling to me, telling me to land.  I get how the tree is one big thing, but the whole world? But what about my vision? It was someone I had never met.  Time is an illusion. So, it's someone I will meet. I think I know how to find them. Everything is connected. Come on! We've got to hurry! Appa!  But what about when the tree showed me where Appa and Momo were?  Hey there, fellow. You look hungry.  What kinda animal is that?   Let's do it! There's a big open space right outside the walls of the city. Don't worry, I'm great with animals.  This was so much easier in my head. Well, Mr. Zookeeper, how do you like your new facilities? Well ... I know it's near water. Momo, marbles please. Hey Katara, check out this airbending trick!  You didn't even look.  But I'm not doing it now.  Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants.  But Appa's tired, aren't you boy?  I said, >aren't you boy?  Look!  That's why we're here. Elephant koi, and I'm gonna ride it. Katara, you've got to watch me! Cold!  Hahaha, hahaha!  Oh man ...  Whaaaahh! Aaaah!  Whaaaahh! I don't know. It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.  This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!  I know her because I'm the Avatar.  That's me!  Now ... check this out!  All right! Dessert for breakfast! These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!  Mmm ... Katara you've got to try these! Sokka, what's your problem? Eat!>  But you're always hungry! What's he so angry about? It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment!  I'm sure we'll be fine. Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town? They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!  Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk. There she is, girls. Me in a past life.  Excuse me for a second, ladies.  Actually, I can't right now. I promised the girls I'd give them a ride on Appa. Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun!  Well, neither does carrying your basket.  I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet. I can't put my finger on it, but there's something I really like about this place.  Just a second, Koko! It didn't. You know what I think? You just don't want to come because you're jealous.> Jealous that we're having so much fun without you. It is a little ridiculous, but I understand.  Hey Sokka! Nice dress!  Katara, remember how Unagi almost got me yesterday?  Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be real dangerous.  You're not going to stop me?  I will.  I know it's great.  I'm glad you're glad.  Fine!  I'm sure it will be here any second! What about this?  Where're you going? Don't leave!  Katara! You showed up! Back there you acted like you didn't care.  Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.  On my way!  Katara ... don't ride Unagi. Not fun.  Hey! Over here!  Look what I brought to this place.  Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me.  I'll call Appa.  Appa, yip yip!  I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous.  I have an idea! Why don't we all get on your back and you could fly us to the North Pole?!  There it is!  We'll find a master to teach us, no problem. My friend and I can't wait to start training with you! After we relax for a couple of days. Good morning, Master Pakku! Uhhh ... This is my friend, Katara. The one I told you about?  Yeah, they're not fair! If you won't teach Katara, then ... Then I won't learn from you! I'm trying ... That bad? Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.  Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.  That was amazing! I was just showing Katara a few moves. I'm sorry, I ... Uhhh ... Katara? I'm sure she didn't mean that. You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher. Go, Katara!  Go get her. Hey, Katara! Good to see you here.  It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.  I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole. What am I gonna do?  You'd do that?  Yeah! Don't start without me, boy!   Oh right. Time to practice waterbending.  You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes.   Mud and bugs!  Like this?  Hey, I'm bending it already!   Well, you had to figure it all on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher. So, what's next? Sorry. Well, don't stop now! Keep 'em coming! So, like this?   Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else do you got?  Uh, sorry. I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff. Uh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!   Sure! What are curios?  Huh?  Momo's not for sale.  Where did you get a waterbending scroll?  I know how to deal with these guys, Katara. Pirates love to haggle. Watch and learn. Let's say to the price of, one copper piece!   Okay, two copper pieces! Aye, we be casting off now!  What was that all about, Katara?  Well, well. Look who's come to their senses. Told you the haggling would pay off. No thanks. Grab on tight! Just hang on!   I used to kind of look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.  No way!  Good one, Katara. Well, what's done is done. We have it, we might as well learn from it. You'll get it. You just gotta shift your weight through the stances. There, see, the key to bending is— It's okay Katara.  What's wrong? No Katara, it isn't. Yeah, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth. I'm over here! Follow my voice! I'm right here! Uh, never mind! I'll find you! Run! Katara, you're okay! A team of rhinos, or two waterbenders. Sokka, can't you make it go any faster? Hey, you did the water whip! Oh no ...  I knew a bison whistle would come in handy! Thanks Appa. That's okay Katara.  Good one, Katara.  Sorry guys, but Appa gets tired carrying all these people. No, she's right. We are here! Why can't I go?  Fair enough. So, what's the new plan?  Oh, yeah. That's great, no problem. I'll just do that. Well, it's not even gonna be possible! Where am I supposed to get a firebending teacher?  Yeah ... right. Like we'll ever run into Jeong Jeong again. Oh well, guess we can't come up with anybody. Why don't we just take a nice tour around the temple?  What? The wind is too loud in my ears! Check out this loop! Okay, we can do that while I show you the giant Pai Sho table! Oh, you're gonna love the all-day echo chamber! There's no way we can trust you after everything you've done. We'll never let you join us. I kind of have a confession to make. Remember when you two were sick and I got captured by Zhao? Anyway, when Zhao had me chained up, it was Zuko who came in and got me out. He risked his life to save me. You're probably right. Or when he tried to capture me at the Fire Temple! I'm not >having Zuko as my teacher! You what? But he did firebend at you? I hate to go looking for a fight, but you're right. After what he did to Toph, I don't think we have a choice. I can't believe I'm saying this, but ... thanks, Zuko.  I think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher. When I first tried to learn firebending, I burned Katara, and after that, I never wanted to firebend again. But now I know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love. I'd like you to teach me.  Not so fast. I still have to ask my friends if it's okay with them. Toph, you're the one that Zuko burned. What do you think?  Sokka?  Katara?  I'll try it! Yeah!  Turns out, clouds are made of water.  Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?  Yes, it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But I don't know how to do my job. Yeah. A waterbending teacher. But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar. Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me. I don't know.   No. Ow! Hey, how is that cheering me up? Thanks, Katara. Nice to meet you too! So ... is there something I can help you with? So, what do you want me to do, exactly? Right ... that's me. Yeah, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the Spirit World. It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff! I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just ... come to me.   Hello, Spirit? Can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking. I'm here to try to help stuff. The sun has set. Where are you, Hei Bai? Well ... spirit ... uhhh ... I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace. Okay ... well ... I guess that's settled, then. You must be the Hei Bai spirit. My name is– My name's Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help. Hey, wait up! Uhhh ... Please, would you stop destroying things and listen? I'm trying to do my job as spirit bridge! Excuse me, would you please turn around? I command you to turn around now! Sokka, go back! I don't want to fight him unless I–  Hang on, Sokka! Sokka! I failed. Katara? Katara, I lost him.  What? No, I'm right here! I'm in the Spirit World! I'll figure this out, Katara. I promise. Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right? All I have to do is ... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem. Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here! But, I guess you can't see me either. What am I supposed to do? Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you? Sokka? That's definitely not Sokka. What? I can't airbend in the Spirit World. You don't know where Sokka is, do you? You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me! I need to save my friend and I don't know how! Is there some way for me to talk to Roku? I'll be back, Katara. Take me to Roku!  Hey, what are you doing? I don't understand, this is just a statue of Roku. Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him? It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice! So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku? But I can't wait that long! I need to save Sokka now!  Whoa! I'm not sure ... You're the spirit of this forest! Now I understand. You're upset and angry because your home was burned down. When I saw the forest had burned, I was sad and upset, but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back.  Actually, I did have a little help and there's something else. I need to talk to Roku and I think I found a way to contact his spirit. There's a temple on a crescent-shaped island and if I go there on the solstice, I'll be able to speak with him. Yeah, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.  Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy! Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us. If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!  But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means! I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the solstice. That's today! Thank you for your- Come on boy, we've got a long way to go. Faster! I'm on it! Yeah. But there's just one little problem. If we fly north, we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade! It's the only way. This is exactly why I didn't want you to come! It's too dangerous! Appa, yip-yip!  Appa, are you okay?   Sokka!   We made it!  There it is! The island where Roku's dragon took me.   You did it buddy. Nice flying.  It's almost sundown. We better hurry!  Great! I am the Avatar!  I'll hold them off. Run!  Follow me!  Nope! Wrong way!   You do?  How? Did you know Avatar Roku? Is that how you knew I was coming? If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the sages attack me?  They were waiting for me. Thank you for helping me.   Shyu, what's wrong? Definitely.  They're still locked!  Why, won't, it, open?!  I'm sorry I put you through all of this for nothing.  Wait. How is Sokka a genius? His plan didn't even work.  Did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years?   The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?  Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing! All I know is airbending! Please Avatar Roku, talk to me!  Is it about that vision? The one of the comet? What does it mean?  So the comet made them stronger?  But that happened a hundred years ago. What does the comet have to do with the War now?  But I haven't even started learning waterbending! Not to mention earth and fire!  What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail? But I won't be able to come back to the temple. What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?  I'm ready.  Thanks. Where's Shyu? Okay, here goes. Man, that's hard. Now that you're the Avatar, it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on. That's the only fair way. Okay. Now, who wants Jinju on their team? Where'd you learn that trick, Aang? Wow! Not only that! We made up a game you can play with the air scooters! Sorry, Aang.  Check this out!  But the true secret, is in the gooey center.  My ancient cake-making technique isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, Aang? The only mistake they made was telling you before you turned sixteen, but we can't concern ourselves with what was. We must act on what is.  Your questions will be answered when you're old enough to enter the air temple sanctuary. Inside, you will meet someone who will guide you on your journey.  When you are ready, he will reveal himself to you. Now, are you going to help me with these cakes, or not? One. Two. Three!  Your aim has improved greatly, my young pupil.  Why did you disappear?  We need you, Aang. Aang, come with us. We need to speak with you. Normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned sixteen, but there are troubling signs. Storm clouds are gathering. We need you, Aang. Very interesting move, young one. Aang has already trained enough for today. No. As long as I'm his guardian, I will decide when he trains ... and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho. Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy. All I want is what is best for him. Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?  Choose well. A sky bison is a companion for life. I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar. Gyatso, I know you mean well, but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment. But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated! The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.  Hello. I am Guru Pathik. I know I'm not the person you expected. And I didn't expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now. The world is full of surprises. Oh, dear. You've been through so much recently. Hurt and betrayed. So twisted up inside. You're still full of love. Ah. But fear has moved in where trust should be. I've been expecting you and the young Avatar for quite a long time. I had a vision many years ago of helping him. That's why I came to the Eastern Air Temple. Oh, your emotions are so turbulent. Like swirling storm clouds. Let the clouds in your mind be gentle, peaceful ones.  Someone looks very well rested, judging by your bed head.  I have prepared a message for Aang. May I attach it to your horn? You and the Avatar's energies are mixed. You have an unbreakable bond. By reading your energy, I can sense where Aang is. Funny, what invisible strings connect us all. I'll see you again, great beast.   Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras. Chakras, chakras, chakras sandwich tastes good. Yum! If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all!  The only way is to let her go. Indeed. I was a spiritual brother of your people and a personal friend of Monk Gyatso.  You must gain balance within yourself, before you can bring balance to the world. And the first step to gaining balance begins with this. Drink up! That's because it is! Yum yum! In order to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Aang, tell me everything you know about chakras.  Oh, I see. I guess we'll start with the basics. The water flows through this creek, much like the energy flows through your body. As you see, there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on. These pools are like our chakras. Exactly. If nothing else were around, this creek would flow pure and clear. However, life is messy, and things tend to fall in the creek. And then what happens? Yes. But, if we open the ponds between the pools ...  There are seven chakras that go up the body. Each pool of energy has a purpose, and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck. Be warned, opening the chakras is an intense experience, and once you begin the process, you cannot stop until all seven are open. Are you ready? First we will open the Earth Chakra, located at the base of the spine. It deals with survival, and is blocked by fear. What are you most afraid of? Let your fears become clear to you. Aang, your vision is not real. You are concerned for your survival, but you must surrender those fears. Let your fears flow down the creek. You have opened your Earth Chakra!  Next is the ... Brilliant! Maybe one day you will be a guru too! This chakra deals with pleasure and is blocked by guilt. Now, look at all the guilt with burdens you so. What do you blame yourself for? Accept the reality that these things happened, but do not let them cloud and poison your energy. If you are to be a positive influence on the world, you need to forgive yourself.  Third is the Fire Chakra, located in the stomach.  Good one! Moving on. This chakra deals with willpower, and is blocked by shame. What are you ashamed of? What are your biggest disappointments in yourself? You will never find balance if you deny this part of your life. You are the Avatar and therefore, you are a firebender. Hmmm ... that chakra opened less like a flowing creek, and more like a ... burping bison. The fourth chakra is located in the heart. It deals with love and is blocked by grief. Lay all your grief out in front of you. You have indeed felt a great loss. But love is a form of energy, and it swirls all around us. The Air Nomads' love for you has not left this world. It is still inside of your heart, and is reborn in the form of new love. Let the pain flow away. Very good. The fifth in the chain is the Sound Chakra, located in the throat. It deals with truth and is blocked by lies. The ones we tell ourselves. You cannot lie about your own nature. You must accept that you are the Avatar. Very good, Aang. You have opened the chakra of truth. The sixth pool of energy is the light chakra, located in the center of the forehead. It deals with insight and is blocked by illusion. The greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation. Things you think are separate and different are actually one in the same.  Yes. We are all one people, but we live as if divided. That's right! Even the separation of the four elements is an illusion. If you open your mind, you will see that all the elements are one. Four parts of the same whole. Even metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined. Yes. Once you open this chakra, you will be able to go in and out of the Avatar State at will and when you are in the Avatar State, you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions. The Thought Chakra is located at the crown of the head. It deals with pure cosmic energy, and is blocked by earthly attachment. Meditate on what attaches you to this world. Now, let all of those attachments go. Let them flow down the river, forgotten. Learn to let her go, or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe. You must learn to let go.  Aang, to master the Avatar State, you must open all the chakras. Surrender yourself. Now think of your attachments and let them go. Let the pure cosmic energy flow. No, Aang! By choosing attachment, you have locked the chakra! If you leave now, you won't be able to go into the Avatar State at all! We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these? You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang. The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics. These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives. You chose them because they were familiar. You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training! Time is short. Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques. Hmph. You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.  I am Avatar Yangchen, young airbender.  Yes. All life is sacred.  Avatar Aang, I know that you're a gentle spirit, and the monks have taught you well, but this isn't about you. This is about the world.  Many great and wise Air Nomads have detached themselves and achieved spiritual enlightenment, but the Avatar can never do it. Because your sole duty is to the world. Here is my wisdom for you: Selfless duty calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs, and do whatever it takes to protect the world.
